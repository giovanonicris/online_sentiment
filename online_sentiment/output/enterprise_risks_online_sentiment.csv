And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and an ally of Mr. Trump’s, would join Meta’s board.

The minutes underlined the Fed’s belief that it may have to slow the rate of cuts.
Along with higher tariffs, volatile trade relations, and tough immigration rules, Trump has also pledged looser regulations on business and tax cuts.

To complicate matters, although bird flu viruses primarily prey on birds, they can also spread to other animals, including humans.
Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, and they’re usually what scientists call dead-end infections because they don’t typically transmit from person to person.
So far, only two bird flu infections in people have been detected this way.
That person, who was over age 65 and had underlying medical conditions, died this month, becoming the first death in the US from bird flu.","['birds', 'pandemic', 'h5n1', 'flu', 'bird', 'milk', 'human', 'viruses', 'infections', 'know', 'cells', 'death', 'virus']",2025-01-08,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/08/health/bird-flu-h5n1-pandemic-risk-explained/index.html,CNN,https://www.cnn.com,negative,-0.195,2025-01-09 21:17:52.470547

7,Misinformation,Starmer condemns ‘lies and misinformation’ as he hits back at Musk - The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting his “lies and misinformation” on grooming gangs were amplifying the “poison” of the far right.
Starmer, the target of wild criticism from Musk on his social media platform X, said the debate on the issue had crossed a line with threats against MPs including the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, whom Musk called a “rape genocide apologist” and said should be jailed.
Responding to the prime minister’s comments on Monday, Musk called him “utterly despicable” and said he was “deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes”.
“Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible, they’re not interested in victims,” he told reporters.
Jay, who chaired the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, distanced herself from calls for a new national inquiry, saying it was critical that her own recommendations were fully implemented.","['child', 'called', 'victims', 'theyre', 'inquiry', 'politicians', 'starmer', 'grooming', 'hits', 'misinformation', 'abuse', 'musk', 'sexual', 'lies', 'condemns']",2025-01-06,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/06/starmer-condemns-lies-and-misinformation-as-he-hits-back-at-musk,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com,negative,-0.188,2025-01-09 21:17:52.470547

The labor market was a key issue on the campaign trail.
Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump often presented distorted views of the health of the labor market, with the Democratic angle largely focusing solely on headline labor market growth and Trump mischaracterizing the gains solely as a pandemic rebound.

Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the advocacy group Free Press, said in a statement that Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, was “saying yes to more lies, yes to more harassment, yes to more hate.”“While Zuckerberg characterized the platform giant’s new approach as a defense of free speech, its real intentions are twofold: Ditch the technology company’s responsibility to protect the health and safety of its users, and align the company more closely with an incoming president who’s a known enemy of accountability,” Ms. Benavidez said.","['metas', 'surge', 'decision', 'benavidez', 'executive', 'disinformation', 'watchdogs', 'warn', 'tech', 'free', 'cause', 'zuckerberg', 'statement', 'yes']",2025-01-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/trump-meta-disinformation.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,+0.163,2025-01-13 11:09:07.130579

“Those who are spreading lies and misinformation, as far and as wide as possible, are not interested in victims,” Mr. Starmer told reporters at an event south of London dedicated to repairing the National Health Service.
“They’re interested in themselves.”Mr. Starmer also defended himself against accusations by Mr. Musk that he did not act quickly enough against gangs that abused and exploited young girls, when he was head of public prosecutions.
Similar gangs were also found to be operating in other towns and cities in England, including Oldham and Telford.
He had tackled the scandal “head on,” he said.","['musk', 'attacks', 'spreading', 'elon', 'uks', 'misinformation', 'prime', 'sex', 'gangs', 'service', 'mr', 'lies', 'victims', 'slams', 'starmer']",2025-01-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/europe/starmer-musk-uk-child-sexual-abuse.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.198,2025-01-13 11:09:07.130579

Key BackgroundThough presidents are often judged on the health of the labor market during their term, most experts agree they have less of an impact on the labor market and the economy than public perception may suggest.
The labor market was a key issue on the campaign trail.
Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump often presented distorted views of the health of the labor market, with the Democratic angle largely focusing solely on headline labor market growth and Trump mischaracterizing the gains solely as a pandemic rebound.

How Quantum Works: Beyond 1s and 0sThe fundamental difference between classical and quantum computing lies in how information is processed.
Paired with wave/particle duality, which allows quantum systems to navigate probabilities and uncertainties, these features make quantum computing ideal for solving optimization challenges at scale.
