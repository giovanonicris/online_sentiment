And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and an ally of Mr. Trump’s, would join Meta’s board.

To complicate matters, although bird flu viruses primarily prey on birds, they can also spread to other animals, including humans.
Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, and they’re usually what scientists call dead-end infections because they don’t typically transmit from person to person.
So far, only two bird flu infections in people have been detected this way.
That person, who was over age 65 and had underlying medical conditions, died this month, becoming the first death in the US from bird flu.","['birds', 'pandemic', 'h5n1', 'flu', 'bird', 'milk', 'human', 'viruses', 'infections', 'know', 'cells', 'death', 'virus']",2025-01-08,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/08/health/bird-flu-h5n1-pandemic-risk-explained/index.html,CNN,https://www.cnn.com,negative,-0.195,2025-01-09 21:17:52.470547

7,Misinformation,Starmer condemns ‘lies and misinformation’ as he hits back at Musk - The Guardian,"Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting his “lies and misinformation” on grooming gangs were amplifying the “poison” of the far right.
Starmer, the target of wild criticism from Musk on his social media platform X, said the debate on the issue had crossed a line with threats against MPs including the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, whom Musk called a “rape genocide apologist” and said should be jailed.
Responding to the prime minister’s comments on Monday, Musk called him “utterly despicable” and said he was “deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes”.
“Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible, they’re not interested in victims,” he told reporters.

The labor market was a key issue on the campaign trail.
Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump often presented distorted views of the health of the labor market, with the Democratic angle largely focusing solely on headline labor market growth and Trump mischaracterizing the gains solely as a pandemic rebound.

Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the advocacy group Free Press, said in a statement that Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, was “saying yes to more lies, yes to more harassment, yes to more hate.”“While Zuckerberg characterized the platform giant’s new approach as a defense of free speech, its real intentions are twofold: Ditch the technology company’s responsibility to protect the health and safety of its users, and align the company more closely with an incoming president who’s a known enemy of accountability,” Ms. Benavidez said.","['metas', 'surge', 'decision', 'benavidez', 'executive', 'disinformation', 'watchdogs', 'warn', 'tech', 'free', 'cause', 'zuckerberg', 'statement', 'yes']",2025-01-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/trump-meta-disinformation.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,+0.163,2025-01-13 11:09:07.130579

“They’re interested in themselves.”Mr. Starmer also defended himself against accusations by Mr. Musk that he did not act quickly enough against gangs that abused and exploited young girls, when he was head of public prosecutions.
Similar gangs were also found to be operating in other towns and cities in England, including Oldham and Telford.
He had tackled the scandal “head on,” he said.","['musk', 'attacks', 'spreading', 'elon', 'uks', 'misinformation', 'prime', 'sex', 'gangs', 'service', 'mr', 'lies', 'victims', 'slams', 'starmer']",2025-01-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/europe/starmer-musk-uk-child-sexual-abuse.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.198,2025-01-13 11:09:07.130579

Key BackgroundThough presidents are often judged on the health of the labor market during their term, most experts agree they have less of an impact on the labor market and the economy than public perception may suggest.
The labor market was a key issue on the campaign trail.
Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump often presented distorted views of the health of the labor market, with the Democratic angle largely focusing solely on headline labor market growth and Trump mischaracterizing the gains solely as a pandemic rebound.

11,Wage Growth,Fewer US interest rate cuts expected after job gains surprise - BBC.com,"The US economy is stronger than expectedFor years, there have been rumblings of concern about a potential downturn in the world's largest economy.
The job gains in December were much higher than the roughly 160,000 analysts had expected: Employers added 256,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% in November to 4.1%, the Labor Department said.
But the strength of this month's data suggests fears about the jobs market may have been premature, removing pressure on the bank to act.
Interest rates on 10 and 30-year government debt in the US jumped after the report, with the latter topping 5%.

11,Wage Growth,December Jobs Report: Labor Market Grew Faster Than Expected As Unemployment Clocks In At 4.1% - Forbes,"Getty ImagesKey FactsThe U.S. added an estimated 256,000 jobs in December, smashing consensus economist estimates of a seasonally adjusted 153,000, according to FactSet.
The unemployment rate was 4.1% last month, compared to forecasts of 4.2%, where it stood in November.
The government also said it revised its prior estimates for October job growth upward by 7,000 and for November job growth downward by 15,000.
That’s because the sharp interest rate cuts long yearned for by borrowers and equity investors may be drying up – the Federal Reserve recently indicated it expects far fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously forecasted – due to a combination of economic factors.

Key BackgroundThough presidents are often judged on the health of the labor market during their term, most experts agree they have less of an impact on the labor market and the economy than public perception may suggest.
The labor market was a key issue on the campaign trail.
Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump often presented distorted views of the health of the labor market, with the Democratic angle largely focusing solely on headline labor market growth and Trump mischaracterizing the gains solely as a pandemic rebound.

The unemployment rate was 4.1% last month, compared to forecasts of 4.2%, where it stood in November.
The government also said it revised its prior estimates for October job growth upward by 7,000 and for November job growth downward by 15,000.
That’s because the sharp interest rate cuts long yearned for by borrowers and equity investors may be drying up – the Federal Reserve recently indicated it expects far fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously forecasted – due to a combination of economic factors.

These regulations designate certain transactions as listed transactions (read: presumed tax shelters) and others as ""transactions of interest""(read: might be a tax shelter).
These regulations also require certain enhanced reporting requirements for the taxpayers and related parties that are involved in these microcaptive transactions, including specifically their material advisors.
In other words, all these folks now must file a tax shelter disclosure form.
By requiring the disclosure of these actuaries, Treasury will in many cases be able to more quickly identify those microcaptive transactions which require greater scrutiny.","['treasury', 'shelter', 'selling', 'tax', 'releases', 'shelters', 'final', 'promoters', 'regulations', 'microcaptive', 'treasurys', 'captive', 'transactions']",2025-01-11,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2025/01/10/us-treasury-releases-final-regulations-on-microcaptive-tax-shelters/,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,+0.122,2025-01-17 20:56:24

8,Bird Flu,FDA orders manufacturers to do a better job detecting bird flu in raw pet food - USA TODAY,"Manufacturers of raw dog and cat food must do a better job detecting bird flu in products sold to pet owners, federal regulators announced Friday.
Several cats, wild and domestic, in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 avian influenza and died from eating raw food contaminated with bird flu.
The raw pet food industry has grown rapidly despite recalls and health warnings, according to USA TODAY reporting.
The rule requires regulated companies to re-analyze their food safety plans when FDA determines it’s necessary, which is the case with the known transmission with bird flu for raw food products.
FDA encouraged pet food manufacturers and others in supply chains to use practices to “significantly minimize or prevent” bird flu transmission via animal food, including with pasteurization.","['manufacturers', 'flu', 'bird', 'raw', 'products', 'job', 'orders', 'pet', 'unpasteurized', 'h5n1', 'cats', 'fda', 'food', 'detecting']",2025-01-18,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/17/raw-pet-food-bird-flu-fda/77784140007/,USA TODAY,https://www.usatoday.com,negative,-0.116,2025-01-20 11:03:49

The deaths prompted policy changes announced Friday by the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration, which focus on pre-slaughter rules for select poultry farms in Minnesota and South Dakota, as well as changes in food safety risk assessments for raw pet food producers.
The agency will also investigate companies if animals have become sickened from eating pet food.
On Monday, county public health officials said five indoor cats in one household were sickened after eating Monarch Raw Pet Food (based in San Jacinto, Calif.); two died.
Health officials say the best way to avoid infection is to cook meat thoroughly and consume only pasteurized dairy products — and to stop feeding raw meat and dairy — commercial or otherwise — to pets.","['deaths', 'usda', 'flu', 'bird', 'poultry', 'raw', 'cats', 'pet', 'production', 'rules', 'h5n1', 'animals', 'food', 'wave', 'prompts', 'virus', 'meat', 'cat']",2025-01-18,https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-01-18/cat-deaths-bird-flu-prompts-pet-food-new-rules,Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com,negative,-0.117,2025-01-20 11:03:49

Establishing a secure identity authorization network would give individuals and businesses a secure way to use verified identity to authorize transactions, agreements, content creation, and other digital actions, in a way that we can instantly trust and execute.
