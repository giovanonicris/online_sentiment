Stephen Ponzio“First of all, a lot of the techniques that are used in machine learning, data science, or statistical analysis have been around for a long time,” Ponzio told Traders Magazine.
Smaller trading firms, in particular, face significant challenges when trying to understand whether their executions are on track or going wrong.
Beyond the volume of data, firms must also ensure their systems are configured correctly to track and interpret execution results.
Without an experienced team to analyze this data, smaller firms may outsource the task to third-party companies.","['performance', 'different', 'ponzio', 'trading', 'leverage', 'improve', 'data', 'execution', 'science', 'brokers', 'traders', 'firms', 'smaller']",2025-02-07,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/traders-leverage-data-science-to-improve-execution/,Traders Magazine,https://www.tradersmagazine.com,positive,+0.052,2025-02-07 13:31:10
3,,Nextrade ATS set to break KRX's 70-year trading monopoly on March 4 - The Korea JoongAng Daily,"Nextrade (NXT), an alternative trading system (ATS), is set to debut on March 4, putting an end to the seven-decades-long monopoly of the Korea Exchange (KRX) as the country’s sole bourse operator.Trading hours will be extended to span from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and investors will be provided with a more diverse range of options for stock investments, according to NXT.“The goal is to secure a market share of at least 10 percent in three years,” said Kim Young-don, a NXT official, during a press briefing on the upcoming alternative trading platform held in western Seoul on Friday.During the early operations following the launch, only 10 stocks will be available for trading, which will gradually increase to 800 by April.NXT will offer pre-market trading from 8 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. and after-hours trading from 3:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., in addition to regular trading hours.
If news reports that could significantly affect investment decisions emerge after 6 p.m., trading for relevant stocks will be halted immediately, and whether to resume trading will be decided the following day.Thirty-two securities firms expressed their willingness to participate in trading so far, with 29 set to take part in the initial trading on March 4.
Of the 29 brokerage firms, 14 will trade only during pre- and post-market hours, not regular hours, in the early phase of the introduction.With the launch of the NXT secondary trading platform, securities firms must adhere to the duty of best execution, meaning they must execute trades on the most favorable terms possible for their customers.
Therefore, when an investor places a buy order for a stock, a brokerage will be required to buy the stock at the lowest price available either on the Korea Exchange’s Kospi and Kosdaq or NXT.NXT expects that introducing an alternative trading system will boost capital inflow into the domestic stock market, as seen in previous cases of financial markets in Australia and the United States.Trading costs for investors will also decline, according to NXT, due to its lower transaction fees — which are about 20 to 40 percent lower than that of KRX — as well as to fresh competition between KRX and NXT.BY SHIN HA-NEE [ [email protected]","['krx', 'trading', 'monopoly', 'alternative', 'system', 'stocks', 'stock', 'nxt', 'set', 'ats', '70year', 'break', 'firms', 'hours', 'nextrade', 'krxs']",2025-02-07,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-02-07/business/finance/nextrade-ats-set-to-break-krxs-70year-trading-monopoly-on-march-4/2237576,The Korea JoongAng Daily,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com,positive,+0.086,2025-02-07 13:31:10

4,,Reasons to consider VCTs post-Budget according to Octopus Investments’ Kristy Barr - IFA Magazine,"Kristy Barr, Co-Head of Retail Investments at Octopus Investments, dives down into why and how VCTs are increasingly providing advisers with unique opportunities to address clients’ tax-planning and portfolio diversification needs.
Two reasons for this include:Stability in outlook: The legislation that backs VCTs has been extended until 2035.
Tax efficiency amplified: Higher Capital Gains Tax rates (18%/24%) make VCT tax relief (income tax relief and tax-free dividends) even more appealing in reducing overall tax liabilities.
It also provides the opportunity to advise on both tax planning and early-stage investments – a typically underserved sector, where our research from 2023 shows investors have unmet appetite.

The prices of essential items, rather than falling as they often do in developed countries during Ramazan to alleviate the financial strain on citizens, have surged.
One particularly notable increase is the recent rise in sugar prices, which has jumped by Rs25 per kilogram.
In the letter, Rehman urged the federal and provincial governments to act swiftly to regulate the prices of essential commodities and ensure they are sold at government-mandated rates.
He also called on Prime Minister Sharif to issue strict directives to all Chief Secretaries across the country to enforce compliance with government price controls during Ramadan.","['govt', 'business', 'intervention', 'rehman', 'manipulation', 'sugar', 'items', 'letter', 'prices', 'sought', 'ramazan', 'essential', 'minister', 'hike', 'likely', 'prime', 'sharif', 'market']",2025-02-07,https://www.brecorder.com/news/40346666/likely-hike-in-prices-of-essential-items-in-ramazan-govt-intervention-sought-to-curb-market-manipulation,Business Recorder,https://www.brecorder.com,positive,+0.054,2025-02-07 13:31:10

Internal data breaches are caused by people inside your company - such as your staff, contractors, or other internal workers.
Typically such data breaches occur because access privileges are abused - either by accident or with malicious intent.
External data breaches, meanwhile, are initiated by people outside the organisation - malicious hackers, cybercriminals, or business rivals seeking a competitive advantage.
It is not uncommon for external data breaches to begin with a phishing email, or exploitation of vulnerabilities on the network.","['reveals', 'netdocuments', 'rise', 'uk', 'internal', 'research', 'data', 'legal', 'sensitive', 'firm', 'external', 'breaches', 'sector', 'law', 'malicious', 'firms']",2025-02-07,https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/research-reveals-data-breaches-rise-uk-law-firms,tripwire.com,https://www.tripwire.com,positive,+0.086,2025-02-07 13:31:10

Despite their limited capability, macOS stealers — the most prevalent of which were Poseidon, Atomic, and Cthulhu — have enabled the optimization of data exfiltration capabilities for further compromise, according to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers.
Infostealers were regarded by Jaron Bradley, threat labs director at Jamf, to have been integral in the escalation of malware aimed at macOS systems, with threat actors increasingly exploiting AppleScript in developing payloads.
Such findings also challenge the greater perceived security of macOS, compared with other operating systems, noted Eric Schwake, director of cybersecurity strategy at Salt Security.

7,,AI chatbots more likely to spread false claims in Russian and Chinese – Report - FactCheckHub,"A recent NewsGuard audit across seven languages has found that the top 10 artificial intelligence models are significantly more likely to generate false claims in Russian and Chinese compared with other languages.
The analysts assessed the models in seven different languages: English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish.
“In languages with weaker fact-checking ecosystems or where state-run media dominates, chatbots default to unreliable or propaganda-driven sources.
As a result, users in authoritarian countries — where access to accurate information is most critical — are disproportionately fed false answers.”As world leaders, AI executives, and policymakers prepare to gather at the AI Action Summit, these reports — aligned with the summit’s theme of Trust in AI — underscore the ongoing challenges AI models face in ensuring safe, accurate responses to prompts, rather than spreading false claims.

Chairman Hill said, “Building upon our work on digital assets in the last Congress, our discussion draft will provide clarity for payment stablecoins and ensure a federal and state path for stablecoin issuers.
The STABLE Act builds on the efforts of former House Financial Services Committee Chair, Patrick McHenry, to provide multiple regulatory pathways for payment stablecoin issuers in the United States.
One of the key differences between the former Chair’s bill, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoin Act of 2023, and the STABLE Act is that the STABLE Act gives the OCC the authority to approve and supervise federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers while the Clarity for Payment Stablecoin Act of 2023 included a federal pathway at the Federal Reserve for payment stablecoin issuers.

Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity.
The team at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Oxford used a photonic quantum network to share the states of trapped ion qubits via quantum gate teleportation (QGT).
These uses dedicated network qubits to deterministically teleport the state of a gate between the two circuit qubits in the separate modules with 86% fidelity.
The two qubit distributed system was then used as a quantum computer to execute an algorithm, Grover’s quantum search algorithm, with a 71% success rate.","['dqc', 'used', 'modules', 'distributed', 'network', 'qubits', 'qgt', 'designs', 'computer', 'quantum', 'qubit', 'scale', 'teleporting', 'computing']",2025-02-06,https://www.eenewseurope.com/en/teleporting-qubits-scale-quantum-computer-designs/,eeNews Europe,https://www.eenewseurope.com,positive,0.058,2025-02-07 00:01:31

2,,Quantum simulator combines digital and analog modes to calculate physical processes with unprecedented precision - Phys.org,"Even the fastest supercomputers are unable to perform the necessary calculations with high precision because the underlying quantum physical processes are extremely complex.
In 1982, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman suggested that, instead of using conventional computers, such questions are better solved using a quantum computer, which can simulate the quantum physical processes efficiently—a quantum simulator.
With the rapid progress now being made in the development of quantum computers, Feynman's vision could soon become a reality.
Digital quantum computers perform their operations using universal quantum gates, similar to the logic gates in classical computers.
Although such purely digital quantum computers are already very powerful, their potential as quantum simulators is still limited.","['magnetic', 'modes', 'computers', 'simulators', 'physical', 'unprecedented', 'simulator', 'using', 'calculate', 'combines', 'qubits', 'milk', 'quantum', 'digital', 'precision', 'processes', 'information']",2025-02-06,https://phys.org/news/2025-02-quantum-simulator-combines-digital-analog.html,Phys.org,https://phys.org,positive,0.107,2025-02-07 00:01:31

3,,"Arthur Hayes Blasts Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Regulatory Bill As 'Net Negatives' - Benzinga India","Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX on Thursday raised concerns over proposals for a strategic Bitcoin BTC/USD reserve and a broad crypto regulatory bill, arguing that both initiatives could be detrimental to the cryptocurrency industry.
Hayes contends that a government-backed Bitcoin reserve could introduce volatility into the market.
He notes that political motivations, rather than financial strategy, would dictate the government’s Bitcoin policies, potentially leading to disruptive sell-offs.
Instead of a government-managed Bitcoin reserve, Hayes proposes that Bitcoin should be recognized as a neutral reserve asset that remains independent of state control.
He suggests that a progressive approach to integrating Bitcoin into the global financial system would provide greater long-term stability than direct government intervention.","['regulatory', 'bill', 'policymakers', 'arthur', 'neutral', 'financial', 'suggests', 'net', 'political', 'strategy', 'reserve', 'hayes', 'blasts', 'strategic', 'negatives', 'bitcoin']",2025-02-06,https://in.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/02/43532705/arthur-hayes-blasts-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-regulatory-bill-as-net-negatives,Benzinga India,https://in.benzinga.com,negative,-0.044,2025-02-07 00:01:31

Scammers often spoof a trusted company or a government agency number (that a called party may already know and trust) to defraud the called party.
Further, certain entities indulge in UCC and spam, annoying customers,” Trai said.Trai said that “critical vulnerabilities exist in today’s increasingly open telecommunication networks”, where signalling mechanisms used for control and management are susceptible to exploitation.“The current Network-Network Interface between telecom service providers (TSPs) relies on an assumption of trust grounded in commercial agreements rather than rigorous technology-based security measures.
This assumed trust, coupled with the proliferation of new interfaces such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunks for non-TSP entities, third-party SMS gateways, and open 5G architecture, creates significant security gaps.","['names', 'trai', 'number', 'telecommunication', 'cnap', 'trust', 'making', 'service', 'mandate', 'entities', 'network', 'spam', 'display', 'curb', 'business', 'calls', 'spoofing', 'frauds', 'party']",2025-02-06,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mandate-display-of-names-when-business-entities-making-calls-to-curb-frauds-trai-to-government/articleshow/117990400.cms,The Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com,positive,+0.168,2025-02-07 13:31:10

4,,Industry Groups File Amicus Brief Urging 11th Circuit to ‘Preserve Integrity of ERISA’ - PLANADVISER,"The industry groups argued in an amicus brief filed Monday that the 11th Circuit should reject the request of the plaintiffs in William Drummond v. Southern Co. Services to rewrite the Employee Retirement Income Security Act’s provisions for calculating qualified joint and survivor annuity benefits.
A joint and survivor annuity is a benefit that pays out an annuity both for the duration of the participant’s life and, once the participant dies, for the life of the participant’s surviving spouse.
The DOL argued in its brief that ERISA’s requirement that a qualified joint and survivor annuity be the “actuarial equivalent” of a single life annuity requires the use of reasonable actuarial assumptions.
John Lowell, a partner in October Three Consulting, says ERISA does not reference “reasonable” actuarial assumptions.
The industry groups’ brief states that a core tenet of ERISA is that employers—not Congress or the courts—determine benefit plan design and the level of plan design.","['annuity', 'plaintiffs', 'joint', 'plan', 'urging', 'circuit', 'brief', 'integrity', 'amicus', 'industry', 'file', 'erisa', 'actuarial', 'court', 'survivor', 'preserve', 'groups', 'reasonable']",2025-02-06,https://www.planadviser.com/industry-groups-file-amicus-brief-urging-11th-circuit-preserve-integrity-erisa/,PLANADVISER,https://www.planadviser.com,positive,+0.121,2025-02-07 13:31:10
2,,Malware Bypasses Google Chrome App-Bound Encryption - The Cyber Express,"Cyble researchers have discovered a sophisticated malware attack that uses dual injection techniques to bypass Google Chrome’s App-Bound Encryption.
Chrome App-Bound Encryption was introduced last year to protect cookies from infostealer malware, so attacks that bypass that protection could potentially access user accounts and other sensitive information.
“By exploiting MSBuild.exe and using a double injection technique, the malware executes directly in memory, making it harder to detect.
The shortcut file copies an XML project file to the Temp directory and initiates a command to create the scheduled task, which launches MSBuild.exe to execute embedded C# code from the XML file.
The threat actor can use that connection to issue a range of commands, such as bypassing Chrome App-Bound Encryption to steal an encryption key, deploying a custom info stealer, and exfiltrating sensitive user data from the Chrome browser, including cookies and login data.","['dual', 'malware', 'cyble', 'encryption', 'chrome', 'xml', 'injection', 'bypasses', 'appbound', 'file', 'bypass', 'malicious', 'researchers']",2025-02-06,https://thecyberexpress.com/malware-bypasses-chrome-app-bound-encryption/,The Cyber Express,https://thecyberexpress.com,negative,-0.118,2025-02-07 13:31:10

8,,Second type of bird flu found in US dairy cows - WDHN,"Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that’s different from the version that has spread in U.S. herds since last year, Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday.
The detection indicates that distinct forms of the virus known as Type A H5N1 have spilled over from wild birds into cattle at least twice.
A version of the H5N1 bird flu virus known as B3.13 was confirmed in March after being introduced to cattle in late 2023, scientists said.
The D1.1 version of the virus was the type linked to the first U.S. death tied to bird flu and a severe illness in Canada.
At least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly those who work closely with dairy or cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","['virus', 'bird', 'officials', 'known', 'flu', 'dairy', 'infected', 'months', 'type', 'cattle', 'version', 'second', 'cows']",2025-02-06,https://www.wdhn.com/news/second-type-of-bird-flu-found-in-us-dairy-cows/,WDHN,https://www.wdhn.com,negative,-0.166,2025-02-07 00:01:31

So far, the company says, 35 per cent of its senior managers are women, 9 per cent are from ethnic minority backgrounds and 14 per cent have a disability.

“For the first time in state history we will have all three branches accountable to the behavioral health system,” said Adrian Avila, Chief of Staff for the Senate Finance Committee.
He said Senate Bill 3 serves as the “guardrails” for the behavioral health system while helping ensure oversight.
Lastly, Senate Bill 1 creates a behavioral health trust fund for the state similar to the state’s trust funds for higher education and early childhood care.
One lawmaker even proposed the idea of an audit to make sure the new behavioral health system is implemented properly.","['system', 'lawmakers', 'bill', 'health', 'fund', 'committee', 'finance', 'package', 'senate', 'state', 'address', 'trust', 'weighs', 'behavioral', 'proposed']",2025-02-06,https://www.aol.com/senate-finance-committee-weighs-proposed-051400597.html,AOL,https://www.aol.com,positive,0.14,2025-02-07 00:01:31

7,,Vatican: AI-generated deepfakes can ‘undermine the foundations of society’ - AOL,"A document released Tuesday by the Vatican outlines ethical guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence and issued a warning that the technology could “undermine the foundations of society.”In the document, Pope Francis highlighted the risks associated with AI.
As the use and capabilities of AI technology rapidly expand, Pope Francis argued that humans need to be more responsible about the tech and careful about its impact on various sectors going forward.
The Vatican noted that AI could be used “as an aid to human dignity” by helping people around the world with research and knowledge.
“On a broader scale, by distorting ‘our relationship with others and with reality,’ AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of society,” the document said.
“As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see and hear, polarization and conflict will only grow,” the Vatican said.","['foundations', 'aigenerated', 'technology', 'risks', 'pope', 'society', 'francis', 'document', 'deepfakes', 'ai', 'video', 'vatican', 'content', 'undermine']",2025-02-06,https://www.aol.com/news/vatican-ai-generated-deepfakes-undermine-190224304.html,AOL,https://www.aol.com,positive,0.108,2025-02-07 00:01:31
7,,Explainable AI can enhance deepfake detection transparency - Tech Xplore,"DOI: 10.3390/app15020725A new study by SRH University emphasizes the benefits of explainable AI systems for the reliable and transparent detection of deepfakes.
In the study recently published in the journal Applied Sciences, the scientists present the use of explainable artificial intelligence (Explainable AI) to increase transparency and reliability in the identification of manipulated media content.
Conventional detection methods often reach their limits, especially when it comes to making the decision-making processes of AI models comprehensible.
The study shows that explainable AI not only improves recognition accuracy, but also promotes understanding and trust in AI technologies.

The bill would not actually prevent people from publishing fake content, no matter how convincing it is.
The Senate Government Operations Committee listens to testimony on a bill concerning the use of artificial intelligence in misleading election messaging at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, Feb. 4.
Beller told the Senate Government Operations Committee on Tuesday that there is at least one case of a law regulating deepfakes that is being stymied by a legal challenge.

And according to testimony from some participants, Congress should also look toward repealing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules tied to overdraft fees and small business lending data collection, arguing that open banking rules should also be delayed.
“Community banks have suffered immensely as increased regulatory requirements force them to devote more and more resources to lawyers and check-the-box compliance programs instead of serving their customers,” the Republican contended.
The “rational regulation” of the industry, she said, would also entail placing the CFPB under the congressional appropriations processes.
Among her own recommendations were to raise the deposit insurance cap for small business accounts and require FinTechs to comply with existing consumer compliance laws, which would level the playing field between those digital upstarts and community banks.","['regulatory', 'community', 'testimony', 'regulation', 'congress', 'cfpb', 'spotlights', 'house', 'banking', 'banks', 'state', 'bank', 'hearing', 'rules', 'rational']",2025-02-06,https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2025/capitol-hill-hearing-spotlights-a-push-for-rational-community-banking-regulation/,PYMNTS.com,https://www.pymnts.com,negative,-0.069,2025-02-07 00:01:31

This decline is attributed to organisations increasingly refusing to pay ransom demands and regulators stepping up their efforts to crack down on cybercriminals.
Despite the first half of 2024 being on track for a record high in payments, pay-outs dropped significantly in the second half of the year as law enforcement and regulators introduced more restrictions to prevent organisations from paying, according to data from Chainalysis.
The firm notes a shift in tactics by ransomware gangs and threat actors, with new strains of ransomware emerging from rebranded, leaked or purchased code, as well as negotiations beginning within hours of data exfiltration.
Nation-state actors, ransomware-as-a-service operations, lone operators and data theft extortion groups were labelled as the common threats.","['ransomware', 'prevent', 'organisations', 'regulators', 'threat', 'enforcement', 'law', 'drop', 'business', 'onethird', 'payments', 'global', 'organisation', 'threats', 'crackdown']",2025-02-06,https://www.bbntimes.com/technology/ransomware-payments-drop-by-one-third-as-regulators-and-business-crackdown-on-global-threats,BBN Times,https://www.bbntimes.com,negative,-0.12,2025-02-07 00:01:31

2,,CPPA Announces Fifth Settlement with Data Broker Over CA Delete Act Violations - Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP,"CPPA Announces Fifth Settlement with Data Broker Over CA Delete Act ViolationsOn January 29, 2025, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”) announced that it had reached a settlement with Connecticut-based data broker Key Marketing Advantage, LLC (“KMA”), resolving the fifth CPPA action against a business for its alleged failure to register as a data broker, as required under California’s Delete Act.
Since 2024, the CPPA has had responsibility for maintaining the Data Broker Registry under the Delete Act.
Notably, the CPPA adopted new data broker regulations under the Delete Act in November 2024 that amended existing data broker regulations.
In particular, the data broker registration fee regulations change the annual registration fee from $400 to $6,600, and the data broker registration regulations define relevant terms, guidance on procedures for registration changes and requirements for data brokers to disclose specific information about their exempt data collection practices, among other requirements.
Notably, the data broker registration regulations specify that a business is “still a data broker if it has a direct relationship with a consumer but also sells personal information about the consumer that the business did not collect directly from the consumer,” substantially broadening the definition of data broker.","['cppa', 'broker', 'settlement', 'brokers', 'ca', 'violations', 'registration', 'register', 'announces', 'data', 'delete', 'regulations', 'act', 'fifth']",2025-02-06,https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/cppa-announces-fifth-settlement-with-data-broker-over-ca-delete-act-violations,Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP,https://www.hunton.com,positive,0.028,2025-02-07 00:01:31

According to the study, that could mean ransomware gangs using agentic AI to attack multiple targets at one time using evolving code, malicious AI agents being tasked to search out and compromise vulnerable targets, or even AI capable of running and fine-tuning malvertising campaigns in real time.
However, the report notes that these AI agents could also become a critical defence tool for cybersecurity teams.
“To combat threat actors using AI to make attacks more potent, organizations need to operate their security as efficiently as possible,” recommends the report.
Despite these concerns, most IT executives see value in scaling the use of agentic AI in their firms, with UiPath’s 2025 Agentic AI Report finding that 90% of IT executives believe business processes would be improved though its use, and over three-quarters (77%) planning to invest more developing agentic AI.","['report', 'agentic', 'threat', 'reshape', 'cybersecurity', 'ai', 'intelligence', 'using', '2025', 'teams', 'agents', 'actors']",2025-02-06,https://www.digit.fyi/will-agentic-ai-reshape-cybersecurity-in-2025/,DIGIT.FYI,https://www.digit.fyi,positive,0.092,2025-02-07 00:01:31

The process involves converting sensitive information into randomised character strings stored in secure token vaults.
During transactions, a tokenisation system receives sensitive information, such as credit card primary account numbers, and converts them into random character strings.
Pablo Fourez, Chief Digital Officer at Mastercard, says: “Today, more than 30% of Mastercard transactions worldwide are tokenised and we intend to continue scaling this rapidly.","['information', 'transactions', 'propels', 'volumes', 'encryption', 'surge', 'data', 'transaction', 'tokenisation', 'mastercard', 'security', 'digital', 'sensitive', 'tokenised']",2025-02-06,https://fintechmagazine.com/articles/tokenisation-propels-surge-in-digital-transaction-volumes,FinTech Magazine,https://fintechmagazine.com,positive,0.083,2025-02-07 00:01:31

2,,Watch This ‘Intelligent’ Liquid That Magically Solves Mazes Without Any Assistance - The Debrief,"Scientists have unraveled the mystery behind an “intelligent” liquid that can solve a maze without assistance, according to new research.
Demonstration of Intelligent Liquid Began as a Tool for LearningInitially designed to demonstrate the overall complexity of fluid systems, the maze-solving intelligent liquid display ultimately became an exhibit in the American Physical Society’s Gallery of Fluid Motion, where it has continually fascinated and perplexed observers.
Surface tension is defined as a liquid’s tendency to shrink into the minimum surface area possible when at rest.
Still, this addition alone did not explain the ability of this seemingly intelligent liquid to choose its path to solve a maze.
This type of resistance gradient results in an intelligent liquid that can effectively choose its path to solve a maze.","['mazes', 'intelligent', 'fluid', 'liquid', 'solve', 'assistance', 'magically', 'watch', 'team', 'tension', 'surface', 'surfactant', 'soap', 'solves', 'maze']",2025-02-06,https://thedebrief.org/watch-this-intelligent-liquid-that-magically-solves-mazes-without-any-assistance/,The Debrief,https://thedebrief.org,positive,0.171,2025-02-07 00:01:31

Originally released in Japanese arcades back in 1988 on the System 1 arcade board, Märchen Maze serves as a (very) loose adaptation of the Lewis Carroll books Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking-Glass.
Following its release in the arcades, Märchen Maze was later ported to the PC Engine in 1990.
However, this specific version of the game ditched the isometric perspective for a more basic overhead view.
A more faithful port for the X68000 was later released in 1991, followed by a reissue of the arcade version for the Wii Virtual Console in 2009.","['wonderlandinspired', 'switch', 'game', 'märchen', 'release', 'coming', 'later', 'version', 'namcos', 'isometric', 'rabbit', 'platformer', 'released', 'ps4', 'alice', 'maze']",2025-02-06,https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/namcos-alice-in-wonderland-inspired-platformer-marchen-maze-is-coming-to-switch-and-ps4,Time Extension,https://www.timeextension.com,positive,0.048,2025-02-07 00:01:31

While bird flu has largely been transmitted by wild birds and thus far mostly impacted Western states, particularly California, the recent cases are deeply concerned for potential impacts to Virginia’s economy,” they wrote.
With bird flu capable of spreading to humans, previous CDC data reported 66 cases in the U.S. last year and 67 since 2022.
Health experts warn that the virus poses a serious threat to those infected, with a staggering 90% fatality rate among reported cases.
As bird flu continues to spread among wild birds and livestock, health officials are closely monitoring the situation — but for now, the public health risk remains low, according to the CDC.","['serious', 'lawmakers', 'mercury', 'bird', 'cdc', 'health', 'reports', 'public', 'reported', 'virginias', 'restart', 'flu', 'disease', 'virginia', 'virus']",2025-02-06,https://virginiamercury.com/2025/02/06/virginia-lawmakers-to-cdc-restart-bird-flu-reports-now/,Virginia Mercury,https://virginiamercury.com,negative,-0.135,2025-02-07 00:01:31

Researchers with security consultancy Chainalysis report that, thanks to stepped up efforts from law enforcement and victim response, the second half of 2024 saw a whopping 35% decrease in payouts to ransomware attackers.
This marks the first time since 2022 that ransomware payouts have seen a decrease, according to Chainalysis.
The drop off is particularly notable because the first half of the year recorded an increase in payouts due to a number of notable ransomware data breach incidents.
“Incident response data show that the gap between the amounts demanded and paid continues to increase,” Chainalysis reports.","['35', 'ransomware', 'chainalysis', 'threat', 'enforcement', 'law', 'drop', 'decrease', 'data', 'increase', 'payments', 'response', 'payouts', '2024', '2022']",2025-02-05,https://www.scworld.com/news/ransomware-payments-drop-35-in-2024-first-decrease-since-2022,SC Media,https://www.scworld.com,positive,0.093,2025-02-07 00:01:31

“Unlawful” Data Sharing with Musk-Led Task ForceThe court document revealed that AFL-CIO sought to halt what it describes as an “ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure” of confidential data.
The lawsuit follows reports that DOGE, a Trump administration task force led by Musk responsible with reducing federal workforce and regulations, gained access to crucial Treasury databases, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems.
According to reports, D.O.G.E’s ability to retrieve taxpayer data raises concerns over potential misuse, particularly regarding politically motivated interference in federal payments.
Meanwhile, Acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his post after more than three decades of service, reportedly in response to D.O.G.E’s request for access to the department’s financial infrastructure.","['treasury', 'action', 'financial', 'doge', 'doges', 'wyden', 'access', 'data', 'union', 'task', 'faces', 'musk', 'trump', 'federal', 'legal']",2025-02-05,https://cryptopotato.com/us-treasury-faces-legal-action-over-d-o-g-es-access-to-financial-data/,CryptoPotato,https://cryptopotato.com,positive,0.174,2025-02-07 00:01:31

Under its existing powers, the FCA can release early information about an investigation in exceptional circumstances.

These records reveal that banks requesting permission to engage in crypto-related activities faced significant delays, repeated requests for additional information, and even pause letters.
FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill stated,“Looking forward, we are actively reevaluating our supervisory approach to crypto-related activities.”This statement suggests a shift in regulatory strategy.
The company requested FDIC records related to the debanking of crypto firms under what has been called Operation Chokepoint 2.0.

Aside from obtaining access to the Treasury Department's payment system for managing federal system — which Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., regarded as a ""security and management failure"" — DOGE was also alleged by Office of Personnel Management employees of having installed an improperly vetted private server that could potentially compromise millions of federal workers' sensitive records.
While DOGE and its employees were noted by the White House to have only been given ""read-only"" access to files, the advisory board's implementation of a new OPM email system poses social engineering and spear-phishing threats to its employees, said Rep.

2,,Ransomware payments dropped in 2024 as victims refused to pay hackers - Yahoo Finance,"Ransomware payments fell by more than one-third in 2024 as an increasing number of victims refused to negotiate with hackers.
In a report published Wednesday, crypto forensics firm Chainalysis said that while ransomware gang leak sites posted more victims than in previous years during 2024, fewer victims gave in to the hackers’ demands.
Chainalysis reported a 35% drop in ransom payments, with ransomware hackers receiving a total of $814 million compared to 2023’s record-high sum of $1.25 billion.
In further evidence of victims refusing to meet attackers’ demands, Chainalysis said that during the second half of 2024, the sums demanded by cyber gangs were 53% higher than the actual payouts — despite an increase in the number of ransomware attacks.
Chainalysis says the surprise decline — the first observed since 2022 — was also driven by an increase in law enforcement action, including the disruption of the prolific LockBit ransomware gang, and improved international collaboration.","['ransomware', 'refused', 'number', 'gang', 'chainalysis', 'demands', 'pay', 'increase', 'dropped', 'victims', 'payments', 'hackers', '2024']",2025-02-05,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ransomware-payments-dropped-2024-victims-185834167.html,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com,negative,-0.16,2025-02-07 00:01:31

“This isn’t just an acquisition—it’s a meeting of missions,” said RSK CEO Alan Ryder, underscoring alignment with Pegasys’ focus on “life-changing” climate adaptation projects.
For now, the acquisition positions RSK to vie with giants like McKinsey Sustainability and Tetra Tech in the race to decarbonize emerging economies.","['bolsters', 'development', 'climate', 'projects', 'clout', 'rsk', 'sustainability', 'water', 'global', 'sustainable', 'acquisition', 'von', 'pegasys', 'rsks']",2025-02-05,https://newsghana.com.gh/rsk-bolsters-global-sustainability-clout-with-pegasys-acquisition/,News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh,positive,0.075,2025-02-07 00:01:31
