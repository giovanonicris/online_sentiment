8,Bird Flu,"Eyeing Potential Bird Flu Outbreak, Biden Administration Ramps Up Preparedness - The New York Times","The Biden administration, in a final push to shore up the nation’s pandemic preparedness before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office, announced on Thursday that it would nearly double the amount of money it was committing to ward off a potential outbreak of bird flu in humans.
The virus has not yet demonstrated that it can spread efficiently among people.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the current risk to humans remains low, and that pasteurized milk products remain safe to consume.
But should human-to-human transmission become commonplace, experts fear a pandemic that could be far more deadly than Covid-19.
On Thursday, the administration said it was committing $306 million toward improving hospital preparedness, early stage research on therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines.","['million', 'ward', 'workers', 'eyeing', 'committing', 'spread', 'virus', 'bird', 'preparedness', 'pandemic', 'administration', 'flu', 'risk', 'outbreak', 'potential', 'biden', 'ramps']",2025-01-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/politics/bird-flu-biden-trump.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,+0.075,2025-01-07 21:10:37.492120
7,Misinformation,Opinion | Musk’s Misinformation About Tech Visas - The New York Times,"Elon Musk and the other tech moguls fluttering around Donald Trump claim that Silicon Valley needs more H-1B visas to bring in foreign workers because there aren’t enough Americans studying science and tech.
But what they don’t tell you is that for more than a decade, Americans working in the tech industry have been systematically laid off and replaced by cheaper H-1B visa holders.
I discovered this in 2013 when I reported an investigative project for The Boston Globe about widespread fraud in and abuse of the H-1B visa program.
At the time, three companies got the largest number of visas in the H-1B lottery: Infosys, Tata and Cognizant.
