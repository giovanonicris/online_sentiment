7,2024 Presidential Election,Harris Faces an Awkward Election Task: Certifying the Vote She Lost - The New York Times,"Under the Constitution, the vice president takes the gavel when the two houses of Congress meet to formally count the Electoral College votes for president.
While not every vice president has chosen to fulfill the duty, Ms. Harris has indicated that she will carry out the task, no doubt painful, of declaring that Donald J. Trump beat her.
A mob he inspired marched on the Capitol and stormed the building to stop Vice President Mike Pence from fulfilling the duty that now falls to Ms. Harris.
Unlike Mr. Trump, Ms. Harris has made no effort to cast doubt on the election but has instead accepted defeat graciously.
Neither she nor President Biden has sought to pressure the Justice Department, members of Congress, governors, state legislators or election officials to reverse the vote she lost, as Mr. Trump did four years ago.","['president', 'vice', 'vote', 'awkward', 'task', 'doubt', 'faces', 'mr', 'harris', 'defeat', 'duty', 'lost', 'trump', 'ms', 'election', 'certifying']",2025-01-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-electoral-vote-certification.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,+0.112,2025-01-06 10:44:50.039344

The general expectation is that the U.K. will take a more principles-based approach to AI regulation, as opposed to the EU's risk-based framework.

Mr. Trump has promised to gut the “deep state” and made various promises to industry supporters.
Among the pledged donors for the inaugural events are Pfizer, OpenAI, Amazon and Meta, along with cryptocurrency firms.
The total haul for the committee financing his inaugural festivities — at least $150 million raised, with more expected — will eclipse the record-setting $107 million raised for his 2017 inauguration, according to three people briefed on the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to share internal financial information.","['raised', 'inaugural', 'donors', 'reeled', 'inauguration', 'violence', 'supporters', 'according', 'trump', '200', 'day', 'election', 'presidential', 'million']",2025-01-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/politics/trump-inaugural-donations.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,+0.13,2025-01-06 10:44:50.039344
