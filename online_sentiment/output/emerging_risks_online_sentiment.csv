Ecuador will hold general elections on Feb. 9 to appoint a president and all seats in the country's National Assembly.
The vote will see President Noboa of the center-right National Democratic Action party run for a full four-year term after serving a compressed 18-month term starting in November 2023.
Based on polling, the presidential election is highly likely to go to a run-off vote scheduled for April 13.

Climate change is significantly impacting agriculture, with extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts, devastating floods, and heatwaves reducing crop yields.
The result is a vicious cycle where climate change exacerbates conflict and conflict, in turn, deepens the impact of climate change on food production.

Other surveys suggest the vote will go to a run-off in April, where he would likely notch a victory against leftist Luisa Gonzalez.
Noboa also faced Gonzalez in the 2023 snap election, where he was the surprise victor to finish the term of his predecessor, winning over voters with pledges to tackle Ecuador's spiraling drug trade-related crime.
""The time of the old Ecuador is over, the new Ecuador is beginning - with your vote we'll reach it,"" Noboa said at a recent rally in Machala.

7,The fundamental flaws with early voting - The Korea JoongAng Daily,"While I personally believe such claims are nothing more than unscientific conspiracy theories, I do see legitimate issues with early voting that are entirely separate from these allegations.Introduced in 2014 during local elections, early voting was initially hailed as a way to boost voter turnout.
However, early voting is held four to five days prior to election day, meaning that early voters cast their ballots with access to the latest poll results, while those voting on election day remain in the dark.Take the 2022 presidential election as an example.
The information asymmetry between early voters and election-day voters is not just unfair — it has the potential to alter electoral outcomes.Another fundamental problem with early voting is that it fails to account for late-breaking political developments.
In 2024, Korea spent 68.7 billion won ($51 million) on early voting, surpassing the 68.0 billion won budget for election day voting.
And the fiscal burden of running early voting operations may not be justified when alternative turnout-boosting measures could be more effective.","['election', 'early', 'won', 'flaws', 'day', 'fundamental', 'ballots', 'voting', 'polling', 'cast', 'voters', 'voter']",2025-02-06,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-02-07/opinion/columns/the-fundamental-flaws-with-early-voting/2236739,The Korea JoongAng Daily,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com,positive,+0.094,2025-02-07 01:17:11

The first instance occurred 20 years ago when Moscow backed presidential candidate Raul Khadjimba.

The inclusion and scope of cotenancy provisions are the product of negotiation between landlord and tenant and are creatures of state contract law.
The case before the Court contemplated whether cotenancy provisions are subject to Section 1671, or in effect, whether such provisions are enforceable under California law.
After a lengthy duration of paying reduced rent premised on the lease’s cotenancy provision, the retail tenant was sued by its landlord, who claimed that the cotenancy provision was unenforceable and demanded over $600,000 plus interest.

Tackle money-laundering first, say experts - CBC News","The roughly 100 organized crime groups operating in Canada (including three groups dedicated to supplying fentanyl) are partly drawn to loopholes and lax penalties that allow fentanyl-related money-laundering operations to flourish, according to researchers.

He added that organized crime groups choose Canada because it puts them inside of what was, at least before the threat of tariffs, a free-trade zone.
Disrupting a crime group's money-laundering operation would be more debilitating than targeting individual fentanyl operations, said Leuprecht.

Historically, third-party vendors had not had to shoulder as much regulatory pressure, often shifting the burden of breaches back onto the institutions they served.
For example, third-party cloud providers had previously been able to avoid disclosing their cybersecurity measures, leaving organisations at risk of violating their own policies.
Third-party risk can lead to a single point of failure which could disrupt an entire financial ecosystem.
DORA aims to harmonise security standards across the financial sector to mitigate the risk of third-party breaches.","['financial', 'risk', 'institutions', 'vendors', 'regulatory', 'fintech', 'failure', 'single', 'breaches', 'dora', 'finserv', 'industries', 'means', 'thirdparty', 'providers']",2025-02-06,https://fintechmagazine.com/articles/what-dora-means-for-fintech-and-finserv-industries,FinTech Magazine,https://fintechmagazine.com,negative,-0.166,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Hayes contends that a government-backed Bitcoin reserve could introduce volatility into the market.
He notes that political motivations, rather than financial strategy, would dictate the government’s Bitcoin policies, potentially leading to disruptive sell-offs.
Instead of a government-managed Bitcoin reserve, Hayes proposes that Bitcoin should be recognized as a neutral reserve asset that remains independent of state control.
He suggests that a progressive approach to integrating Bitcoin into the global financial system would provide greater long-term stability than direct government intervention.","['financial', 'neutral', 'arthur', 'bill', 'regulatory', 'political', 'net', 'blasts', 'reserve', 'strategy', 'bitcoin', 'hayes', 'negatives', 'strategic', 'suggests', 'policymakers']",2025-02-06,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/02/43532705/arthur-hayes-blasts-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-regulatory-bill-as-net-negatives,Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com,negative,-0.044,2025-02-07 01:17:11

17,Capitol Hill Hearing Pushes for ‘Rational’ Community Banking Regulation - PYMNTS.com,"Beware the dangers of regulatory “overreach” and a one-size-fits-all approach to community banking oversight, several industry participants testified at a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday (Feb. 5).
And according to testimony from some participants, Congress should also look toward repealing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules tied to overdraft fees and small business lending data collection, arguing that open banking rules should also be delayed.
“Community banks have suffered immensely as increased regulatory requirements force them to devote more and more resources to lawyers and check-the-box compliance programs instead of serving their customers,” the Republican contended.
The “rational regulation” of the industry, she said, would also entail placing the CFPB under the congressional appropriations processes.
Among her own recommendations were to raise the deposit insurance cap for small business accounts and require FinTechs to comply with existing consumer compliance laws, which would level the playing field between those digital upstarts and community banks.","['community', 'bank', 'rules', 'cfpb', 'regulation', 'house', 'banking', 'rational', 'regulatory', 'state', 'spotlights', 'congress', 'hearing', 'testimony', 'banks']",2025-02-06,https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2025/capitol-hill-hearing-spotlights-a-push-for-rational-community-banking-regulation/,PYMNTS.com,https://www.pymnts.com,negative,-0.069,2025-02-07 01:17:11

13,Opinion: What China’s DeepSeek breakthrough really means for the future of AI - Los Angeles Times,"This sharp cost reduction has already attracted smaller AI developers looking for a cheaper alternative to high-profile AI labs.
AdvertisementAt first glance, reducing model-training expenses in this way might seem to undermine the trillion-dollar “AI arms race” involving data centers, semiconductors and cloud infrastructure.
That means the sky is not falling for Big Tech companies that supply AI infrastructure and services.
Major tech players are projected to invest more than $1 trillion in AI infrastructure by 2029 , and the DeepSeek development probably won’t change their plans all that much.

15,"PNNL Scientists Use Quantum Computing to Tackle Turbulence, a Long-Standing Scientific Challenge - The Quantum Insider","The PNNL team, which includes physicists, quantum computing experts, biologists, chemists, and Earth scientists, devised a quantum algorithm that reformulates the Boltzmann equation, which is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics.
Their approach suggests that quantum computing could offer a speed advantage over classical methods, potentially making complex turbulence simulations feasible.
The researchers formed a study group to explore the problem further, and their discussions led them to quantum computing.
“I’d been dreaming about working on quantum computing for turbulence or even quantum turbulence since 2016,” said Li.
They enrolled in PNNL’s annual Quantum Bootcamp, where they met Nathan Wiebe, a quantum computing specialist and professor at the University of Toronto.","['challenge', 'research', 'complex', 'longstanding', 'turbulence', 'computing', 'team', 'simulations', 'pnnl', 'climate', 'scientific', 'scientists', 'tackle', 'cloud', 'quantum']",2025-01-31,https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/01/31/pnnl-scientists-use-quantum-computing-to-tackle-turbulence-a-long-standing-scientific-challenge/,The Quantum Insider,https://thequantuminsider.com,positive,0.036,2025-01-31 21:07:24

15,What’s Next For Quantum Computing In 2025? - Science Friday,"It seems that every few months, there’s an exciting breakthrough in quantum computing, a kind of computing that takes advantage of quantum physics to perform calculations exponentially faster than our most advanced supercomputers.
And earlier this month, Microsoft, coming off a quantum advance in the fall, told businesses to get “quantum-ready” for 2025, saying that “we are right on the cusp of seeing quantum computers solve meaningful problems.”So, are we on the cusp?
Flora Lichtman is joined by Dr. Shohini Ghose, a quantum physicist and professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Canada and CTO of the Quantum Algorithms Institute, for a quantum computing check-in and a look at when this futuristic technology could start to have an impact on our lives.

First-installment property tax bills due this coming spring just were mailed out, but they don’t reflect the latest reassessments.
The bottom line is that this war between the assessor and the Board of Review is serving no one’s interests.

4,Are these asset classes set to take CRE by storm in 2025? - Mortgage Professional,"The shrinkage of apartment sizes over the last 20 years, coupled with the continuing clamor of workers – especially younger generations – to live in cities, are trends that have seen demand for self-storage grow.
“You go back 20, 25 years, that phenomenon started in major cities like New York and Chicago where every square foot was worth a lot of money and you saw apartments shrinking,” he told Mortgage Professional America.
“However, that has expanded out in the market to other areas as well.
“People are willing to take a smaller apartment in order to keep the rent slightly more affordable, so we’ve definitely seen more people living in smaller apartments.
That’s due, in part, to high demand for non-conventional storage options, the research firm said, as well as small-scale business expansion and higher demand for climate control.","['cre', 'seen', 'winter', 'smaller', 'asset', 'set', 'classes', 'saw', '2025', 'apartments', 'market', 'demand', 'summer', 'lot', 'selfstorage', 'storm']",2025-01-31,https://www.mpamag.com/us/specialty/commercial/are-these-asset-classes-set-to-take-cre-by-storm-in-2025/522893,Mortgage Professional,https://www.mpamag.com,positive,0.08,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The survey further says the manufacturing sector faces pressures due to weak global demand and domestic seasonal conditions.
But it quickly also notes that this has been visible across the globe with manufacturing slowing especially in Europe and parts of Asia, due to supply chain disruptions and weak external demand.“ Private consumption remains stable, reflecting steady domestic demand.","['fiscal', 'lowers', 'growth', 'manufacturing', 'forecast', 'stable', 'economic', 'domestic', 'seasonal', 'weak', 'demand', 'survey', 'global', 'poor']",2025-01-31,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2025/Jan/31/economic-survey-lowers-growth-forecast-to-63-68-blaming-weak-global-demand-poor-manufacturing,The New Indian Express,https://www.newindianexpress.com,negative,-0.112,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The lower production of onions in 2022-23 and 2023-24 has also led to inflationary pressures in onions.
Tomato production, the survey noted, is mainly concentrated in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Odisha and this regional concentration makes the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions in any of these areas.

6,Gold Prices Soar Amid Tensions: What You Need to Know! - Trabajo News,"Recent market dynamics have sent gold prices on an exhilarating ride, dancing tantalizingly close to the $2,800 milestone during Friday’s Asian trading session.
Understanding the Current Gold Market LandscapeRecent fluctuations in the gold market have caused prices to approach an astounding $2,800 per ounce, primarily driven by rising geopolitical tensions and concerns surrounding U.S. trade policies.
U.S. Treasury Yields Impact:An uptick in U.S. Treasury yields has provided temporary support for the U.S. dollar, which affects gold prices inversely.
Cons: The gold market can be volatile, and gold does not generate income like stocks or bonds, leading to potential opportunity costs.
With macroeconomic factors continually influencing prices, gold remains a crucial hedge against market volatility.","['treasury', 'tensions', 'know', 'gold', 'need', 'inflation', 'geopolitical', 'economic', 'market', 'amid', 'investors', 'remains', 'soar', 'yields', 'prices']",2025-01-31,https://trabajocooperativo.com.ar/49/gold-prices-soar-amid-tensions-what-you-need-to-know/3112/,Trabajo News,https://trabajocooperativo.com.ar,positive,0.132,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The survey cites an IMF paper suggesting governments could impose taxes on corporate profits achieved through labor replacement by AI.
A labor-rich country like India cannot afford prolonged labor displacement without risking its growth potential, the document asserts.
To align AI use with societal values and cushion workers from negative economic impacts, the survey recommends regulatory changes and educational reforms.
It advocates for institutions to support workers in adapting to AI-induced shifts, portraying AI as both a challenge and an opportunity for India's unique economic landscape.","['unique', 'workers', 'navigating', 'values', 'uncertainty', 'warns', 'landscape', 'economic', 'aiera', 'indias', 'unavoidablethe', 'potential', 'survey', 'labor', 'ai']",2025-01-31,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3247259-ai-era-labor-navigating-uncertainty-in-indias-economic-landscape,Devdiscourse,https://www.devdiscourse.com,positive,0.181,2025-01-31 21:07:24

15,New Method of Detecting Atom Loss Paves the Way for Quantum Computing Progress - Thomas Insights,"‘Atom loss’ is a pressing matter in quantum computing, and scientists at Sandia National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico (UNM) have developed a method of detecting atom loss without disrupting a qubit’s quantum state.
But before we dive into the discovery, here’s a quick overview on what atom loss is.
A New Technique to Detect Atom LossIt has been nearly impossible to detect atom loss in quantum computers.
It detects atom loss by mapping this information onto a separate ancilla qubit, which acts like an ‘observer’ without disturbing the qubit.
Thanks to their non-destructive method of detecting atom loss, the Sandia-UNM team believes their breakthrough represents a major advancement in quantum computing.","['technique', 'past', 'way', 'rendering', 'sandia', 'computers', 'atom', 'qubits', 'loss', 'problem', 'scientists', 'quantum', 'computing']",2025-01-31,https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/detecting-atom-loss-quantum-computing/,Thomas Insights,https://www.thomasnet.com,negative,-0.103,2025-01-31 21:07:24

Since the tool made its debut this month, rattling stock markets and more established tech giants like Nvidia, researchers testing its capabilities have found that the answers it gives not only spread Chinese propaganda but also parrot disinformation campaigns that China has used to undercut its critics around the world.

The example was among several documented by researchers at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, in a Thursday report that called DeepSeek “a disinformation machine.”In the case of the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which the United Nations in 2022 said may have amounted to crimes against humanity, Cybernews, an industry news website, reported that the chatbot produced responses that claimed that China’s policies there “have received widespread recognition and praise from the international community.”","['answers', 'propaganda', 'researchers', 'deepseek', 'include', 'chatbot', 'deepseeks', 'gives', 'china', 'chinese', 'chinas', 'youre', 'disinformation', 'say']",2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/technology/deepseek-chinese-propaganda.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,0.086,2025-01-31 21:07:24

What If Adversaries Overtake the US?
And if it becomes known that the U.S. has indeed been overtaken by an adversary, the IC should strive to determine which of its information has not been shielded by post-quantum cryptography and deem that data as compromised.
The IC would also have to determine what the adversary would do with its technology and what steps the U.S. should take to mitigate against and catch up.","['ic', 'work', 'discusses', 'race', 'computing', 'paper', 'information', 'adversary', 'technology', 'mitre', 'role', 'adversaries', 'data', 'quantum']",2025-01-30,https://executivegov.com/2025/01/mitre-intelligence-community-quantum-computing/,Executive Gov,https://executivegov.com,positive,0.084,2025-01-31 21:07:24
