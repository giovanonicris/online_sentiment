'Fundamentally human'For Bensamoun, AI is an important tool, but it should be viewed as just that: a tool, to be used by humans, rather than something that replaces human endeavour.
Artistic and literary creation is “fundamentally human and it is important to recognise the uniqueness of human creation and to protect it,” she said.
One recent example that garnered media attention was the case of the late actor Alain Dorval, the French “voice” of American action hero Sylvester Stallone.","['voice', 'ahead', 'expert', 'intelligence', 'legal', 'paris', 'remain', 'creation', 'ai', 'artificial', 'french', 'fundamentally', 'public', 'summit', 'human', 'bensamoun']",2025-02-08,https://www.rfi.fr/en/science-and-technology/20250208-creation-must-remain-fundamentally-human-says-expert-ahead-of-paris-ai-summit,RFI English,https://www.rfi.fr,positive,0.169,2025-02-08 09:21:17

13,Advancements in Seed Quality Evaluation Using Artificial intelligence and 2D X-Ray Imaging - Seed World,"A recently published study has made significant advancements in the automated detection of internal seed defects using artificial intelligence combined with 2D X-ray imaging.
This innovative approach employs advanced deep learning models to analyze 2D X-ray images with remarkable accuracy and time efficiency.
A key technological challenge in utilizing artificial intelligence is obtaining a large, balanced database of data.
To address these challenges, a strategy was developed based on artificial data augmentation (X-Robustifier) to account for the natural variability in seed morphology, fluctuations in X-ray imaging conditions, and the typically low occurrence of defective seeds.
Some tests even demonstrated the model’s robustness and its ability to perform well on coated seeds or in 2D projections derived from 3D tomography images.","['intelligence', 'xray', 'quality', '2d', 'variations', 'research', 'advancements', 'robustness', 'imaging', 'models', 'evaluation', 'seeds', 'seed', 'using', 'artificial']",2025-02-07,https://www.seedworld.com/europe/2025/02/07/advancements-in-seed-quality-evaluation-using-artificial-intelligence-and-2d-x-ray-imaging/,Seed World,https://www.seedworld.com,positive,0.205,2025-02-07 14:42:12

15,Coldest-ever qubits could lead to faster quantum computers - Livescience.com,"A new type of autonomous quantum refrigerator could give quantum computers ""a major performance boost"" and make them more reliable, scientists say.
Quantum computers need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures so scientists can tap into delicate quantum properties and perform calculations — as even the smallest environmental disturbance can ""flip"" their quantum state, causing errors.
In this state, qubits are likely to retain their quantum properties long enough to perform calculations accurately .
It does this by harnessing energy from reservoirs of heat created using microwave radiation, which is then directed into one of the quantum refrigerator's two qubits.
And unlike quantum dilution refrigerators, which are extremely complex and difficult to scale, the new, thermally-driven system is autonomous, meaning it doesn't require external control once started.","['computers', 'qubits', 'study', 'coldestever', 'refrigerators', 'quantum', 'lead', 'heat', 'minus', 'qubit', 'dilution', 'scientists', 'faster', 'state']",2025-02-07,https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/coldest-ever-qubits-could-lead-to-faster-quantum-computers,Livescience.com,https://www.livescience.com,negative,-0.073,2025-02-07 14:42:12

15,Scientists Link Quantum Computers Via Teleportation In Breakthrough Achievement - NDTV,"In a breakthrough achievement towards making quantum computing practical on a large scale, scientists at the University of Oxford have successfully demonstrated distributed quantum computing for the first time.
Quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits) instead of the traditional bits of classical computers which can perform calculations at speeds unattainable by today's technology.
To overcome the obstacle, the researchers, instead of moving qubits to achieve quantum teleportation, used quantum teleportation of logical gates (the minimum components of an algorithm) – across a network link.
""Previous demonstrations of quantum teleportation have focused on transferring quantum states between physically separated systems.

Similarly, the US Copyright Office issued part two of its “Copyright and Artificial Intelligence” report, addressing the copyrightability of AI- or partially AI-made works.
The PTO stated that it is still evaluating the issue of AI-assisted inventions but reaffirmed its February 2024 guidance on inventorship for AI-assisted inventions.
That guidance indicates that while AI-assisted inventions are not categorically unpatentable, the inventorship analysis should focus on human contributions.
The Copyright Office stated that creativity in the AI prompt alone is, at this state, insufficient to satisfy the human expressive input required to produce a copyrightable work.","['assessing', 'protections', 'intellectual', 'inventions', 'role', 'pto', 'determining', 'ai', 'aiassisted', 'ais', 'copyright', 'strategy', 'office', 'guidance', 'property', 'works', 'human', 'inputs']",2025-02-07,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/assessing-inputs-determining-ai-s-role-9262538/,JD Supra,https://www.jdsupra.com,positive,0.075,2025-02-08 09:21:17

“Surprisingly, we found that under certain conditions, training in a noise-free environment can lead to better performance when tested in a noisy environment,” they wrote in their paper.
That’s because training the AI in quiet, controlled conditions lets it master the basics, which it can then better apply to the real world.
Counterintuitively, this results in better performance than an AI trained in messier conditions akin to the real world.
But the challenge in training these robots is the difficulty of duplicating real-world conditions in the lab.","['agents', 'noisy', 'conditions', 'ai', 'trained', 'boost', 'environment', 'discovers', 'paradox', 'better', 'robots', 'mit', 'researchers', 'training']",2025-02-07,https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/mit-discovers-ai-training-paradox-that-could-boost-robot-intelligence/,PYMNTS.com,https://www.pymnts.com,positive,0.106,2025-02-07 14:42:12

4,"Commercial real estate companies expect their revenues to increase in 2025, but remain cautious about changing market conditions - The Diplomat Bucharest","Almost 90 percent of commercial real estate companies (commercial spaces, business centers and office, logistics premises) expect their revenues to increase in 2025, but remain cautious about the changing market conditions, and 60 percent anticipate an annual growth of more than 5 percent, after two consecutive years in which most participants expected revenue declines, according to Deloitte 2025 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.
At the same time, more than 68 percent of participants (compared to 27 percent last year) expect real estate fundamentals to improve across areas such as cost of capital, capital availability, property prices, transaction activity, rental growth, and vacancies.
“Real estate companies’ concern about elevated interest rates is not about further rate increase this year compared to previous years, but rather about the probability of facing a high-rate environment for a longer period, compared to the record low-rate levels from the prior decade.
Consequently, real estate players have to adapt their business model to the new reality in the financial market and diversify their sources of financing.

15,Coldest-ever qubits could lead to faster quantum computers - Yahoo! Voices,"The new cooling technology could give quantum computers ""a major performance boost,"" scientists said.
| Credit: Chalmers University of Technology | Lovisa HåkanssonA new type of autonomous quantum refrigerator could give quantum computers ""a major performance boost"" and make them more reliable, scientists say.
Quantum computers need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures so scientists can tap into delicate quantum properties and perform calculations — as even the smallest environmental disturbance can ""flip"" their quantum state, causing errors.
“Energy from the thermal environment, channeled through one of the quantum refrigerator’s two qubits, pumps heat from the target qubit into the quantum refrigerator’s second qubit, which is cold.
""This might seem like a small difference, but when performing multiple computations, it compounds into a major performance boost in the efficiency of quantum computers,"" he added.","['faster', 'qubits', 'refrigerators', 'technology', 'heat', 'qubit', 'computers', 'state', 'quantum', 'minus', 'lead', 'coldestever', 'scientists']",2025-02-07,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/coldest-ever-qubits-could-lead-131500782.html,Yahoo!

17,Need to create regulatory framework to withstand AI’s unethical use: Piyush Goyal - The Economic Times,"ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThere is a need to create a robust regulatory framework with legal and policy assistance to withstand the unethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) and also support effective deployment of modern technology, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.At an event organised by the National Law University, Delhi, he also said copyright and AI today stand at the crossroads of a “very disturbing future” as AI has “every potential to disrupt the way we are working today”.“The speed at which we feel a ChatGPT or whatever the Chinese are now invented, I don’t even recognize that.
But irrespective, I do believe we are a long way away before we can consider that to be dependable,” Goyal said.His statement comes after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, became the most downloaded app.“It is important that policy makers and I receive your help to create the right regulatory framework, not necessarily only in copyrights, but through the various aspects of law that can be impacted through use of AI, and come up with robust regulations that can withstand both the misuse or unethical use of AI and which will also support ethical use of modern practices or technologies,” Goyal said.Noting that the government is seeing how it can engage with experts and colleges across the country to see what regulations need change to be able to adapt with modern times, he said: “I do hope we'll spend the next 12 or 18 months in working out more contemporary regulatory framework”.On the issue of copyright and AI, he said one sees near perfect counterfeits and copyrights these days.“One can visit China, and you can get all your Louis Vuitton and Hermes bags, also from a range of probably Rs 1,000-10 lakh, and you won't be able to prima facie (find the difference), and that after a month or two, it will start getting spoilt,” the minister said, adding that this is the case with a lot of substandard goods that used to come into the country.However, India is trying to stop these substandard imports through a greater focus on quality control orders and compete on equal terms with other high quality products.“Copyright and artificial intelligence today literally stand at the crossroads of a very, very disturbing future where we can either convert the use of AI ethically to advantage so that we can do a good thing as regulators of copyright, or we may land up with smart ways, through unethical use of AI, to misuse copyright protection… AI, in fact, truly has every potential to disrupt the way we are working today,” Goyal added.While on the one hand, AI can add to creativity, on the other hand, it can disrupt the authorship of genuine innovators and their rights, he cautioned.“But personally, I am not very worried about the advent of technology,” he said adding that technology can become a tool, but cannot ever substitute the human mind.“I do believe, with all advent of technology through the years, the human indomitable spirit has always prevailed.
And I am very confident that in the years ahead, we will continue to see the human mind holding forth, the human mind prevailing over all artificial intelligence,” he said.As per the minister, the Patents Office granted one lakh patents in 2024, from 6,000 patents in 2014.","['withstand', 'need', 'framework', 'ais', 'technology', 'human', 'today', 'unethical', 'copyright', 'regulatory', 'piyush', 'create', 'ai', 'working', 'way', 'goyal']",2025-02-07,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/need-to-create-regulatory-framework-to-withstand-ais-unethical-use-piyush-goyal/amp_articleshow/118023916.cms,The Economic Times,https://m.economictimes.com,positive,+0.139,2025-02-08 10:26:50

Sukhumi has long been a cherished destination on the Black Sea, particularly popular among Russian tourists since the Soviet era.
The airport closure in the 1990s was due to a conflict during which Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia.
Russia recognized Abkhazia and another separatist region, South Ossetia, as independent states after a brief conflict with Georgia in 2008, though most of the world still considers them part of Georgian territory.
The renewal of flights hints at a slight thaw in the fraught relations between Russia and Georgia, as Georgia's Western alliances face challenges.","['russian', 'abkhazia', 'flights', 'georgias', 'region', 'georgia', 'decades', 'russia', 'flight', 'conflict', 'world', 'resumes']",2025-02-07,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3256712-russia-resumes-flights-to-abkhazia-after-three-decades,Devdiscourse,https://www.devdiscourse.com,positive,0.059,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Trump has slapped levies on all imports from China, with the world’s biggest oil importer countering with its own more restrained measures, which will come into force on Monday.The trade war — and the potential for it to spread — has stoked concerns that it will hamper growth in crude demand and lead to a glut later in the year.
Trump has also pledged to boost US oil output, offsetting the sanctions on Iran, which may limit flows from the OPEC member.“With the majority of Iran’s remaining oil exports going to China, we will be watching if the country’s imports will be part of the broader US-China tariff dialog,” RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft said in a note.
“However, questions remain about the duration of these measures and the potential rigor that will be applied to enforcement.”Crude has had a tumultuous week, soaring on Monday as sanctions were set to come into effect on Canada and Mexico — the two biggest foreign suppliers of crude to the US — before sliding as the measures were delayed by a month.
It extended those declines to the lowest level this year as the conflict with China raised concerns about demand growth.There are also signs of a loosening in physical markets.","['potential', 'measures', 'demand', 'week', 'iran', 'set', 'weekly', 'crude', 'trump', 'near', 'tariffs', 'china', 'oil', 'drop', 'outweigh', 'sanctions']",2025-02-07,https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/oil-set-for-weekly-drop-as-trump-tariffs-outweigh-iran-sanctions-19554212.htm,CNBCTV18,https://www.cnbctv18.com,negative,-0.103,2025-02-07 14:42:12

The property veteran agreed it is hard to manage stamp duty cuts, but he pointed out that more relaxed measures would help reduce the burden on home buyers.
They included a 7.5 percent stamp duty on buyers who are not permanent residents, a 7.5 percent stamp duty on those purchasing a second home and a 10 to 20 percent stamp duty on those who sell their homes within two years of the purchase.

4,What Is a Defeasance Clause in Real Estate? - AOL,"How Defeasance Clauses Work in Residential MortgagesIn residential mortgages, a defeasance clause provides a clear path for borrowers to gain full property ownership once the loan terms are fulfilled.
In these states, defeasance clauses are less common because the lien is automatically removed once the borrower fulfills the repayment terms.
Defeasance clauses in commercial real estate loans offer borrowers flexibility while ensuring lenders continue to receive consistent cash flow.
Defeasance clauses illustrate the diverse strategies lenders and borrowers use to meet financial and contractual obligations in real estate transactions.

Fertilisers are critical to agricultural production and global food security, but they also have a considerable impact on greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation.
Geopolitical tensions, the conflict in Ukraine, and reliance on important producers such as China, Russia, and Morocco have disrupted supply chains, worsening food insecurity, particularly in low-income areas.
The paper also emphasises the geopolitical ramifications of fertiliser supply chains, as countries use them for economic statecraft.
The authors propose a research program that will investigate these interdependencies and provide solutions for developing resilient, sustainable, and equitable fertiliser supply chains in the context of decarbonisation.","['resilience', 'article', 'critical', 'security', 'fertilizer', 'advocates', 'food', 'chains', 'sustainable', 'supply', 'global', 'nexus', 'chain', 'geopolitics', 'thinking', 'production', 'fertiliser']",2025-02-07,https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/brandtschool/media-events/media/news/newsdetail/article-advocates-nexus-thinking-for-sustainable-fertilizer-and-supply-chain-resilience,News der Uni Erfurt,https://www.uni-erfurt.de,negative,-0.133,2025-02-08 09:21:17

The unanimous ruling lets the longtime director of the state Elections Commission stay in her job and stymies the ability of Republicans to name a replacement.
The three Democrats on the commission abstained from the vote, saying a recent state Supreme Court ruling allowed her to remain in the job indefinitely.
A county judge agreed with Kaul, and GOP state lawmakers appealed the case to the state Supreme Court.
The ruling allows Wolfe to stay in the job unless the commissioners decide they want someone else in the post.","['lets', 'ruling', 'elections', 'setback', 'gop', 'director', 'wisconsin', 'court', 'state', 'commission', 'stay', 'wolfe', 'republicans', 'senate', 'job']",2025-02-07,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/07/wisconsin-elections-commission-director/,The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com,positive,0.146,2025-02-08 09:21:17

Weintraub, a Democrat, has served as an FEC commissioner since 2002 and was just elected as the chair for 2025.
She said she received a letter from Trump, dated Jan. 31, saying “You are hereby removed as a Member of the Federal Election Commission, effective immediately.”However, she pushed back against the letter, saying Trump can’t remove her that way.

(Carlos Osorio/AP)The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that the state’s top election official, Meagan Wolfe, can remain in her role as a holdover after her term, rejecting state Senate Republicans’ attempts to oust her.
Wolfe has served in the role since she was appointed by WEC and confirmed by the state Senate in 2019.
This is because the state Senate needs to confirm WEC’s appointee for administrator, and the Democrats were concerned GOP legislators would reject her appointment, effectively firing her.
Despite WEC commissioners not voting to reappoint her, the state Senate voted on her appointment anyway, rejecting her along party lines in September 2023.
That same month, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) filed a lawsuit on behalf of Wolfe and WEC challenging Senate Republicans’ vote to remove her.","['amid', 'term', 'wec', 'senate', 'gop', 'court', 'wisconsin', 'state', 'administrator', 'official', 'wolfe', 'supreme', 'appointment', 'election', 'effort', 'oust', 'job']",2025-02-07,https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/wisconsin-supreme-court-allows-top-election-official-to-keep-job-amid-gop-effort-to-oust-her/,Democracy Docket,https://www.democracydocket.com,negative,-0.08,2025-02-08 09:21:17

The new spending may be a sign the Air Force is inclined to procure a manned Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-generation jet fighter after all, despite the service’s leaders spending much of 2024 arguing it was unaffordable and possibly unnecessary.
And at the moment, the Air Force has yet to commit to buying one it can’t afford anyway.

The use of these names by nations for both land and maritime areas varies significantly within the context of politicizing geographical names (Toponymy) and their official recognition on relevant maps.
This approach was officially adopted in 1979, enabling Taiwan to engage in some international activities while avoiding political disputes.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a briefing that China ""firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.""
""The United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack,"" Rubio said.
An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway in Panama and could lead to a rebidding process.
Lin said the Belt and Road Initiative had brought ""active participation"" from over 150 countries and that it has brought ""fruitful results"" to Panama and China, but gave no examples.","['mulino', 'road', 'derides', 'coercion', 'canal', 'president', 'standoff', 'china', 'panama', 'rubio', 'belt', 'united', 'state', 'scraps', 'deal', 'pressure']",2025-02-07,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-us-trump-panama-canal-pressure-coercion-belt-and-road-deal/,CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com,negative,-0.066,2025-02-08 09:21:17
10,China quietly supplies minerals to Russia's war machine in Ukraine: Report - Newsweek,"Chinese state-linked companies are providing Russia with three strategic minerals critical to military technologies, despite Beijing's claims of neutrality, according to a report.
Newsweek reached out to the Chinese and Russian foreign ministries and U.S. Department of the Treasury by email with a request for comment.
Why It MattersSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, China has become an economic lifeline for Moscow, strengthening trade and military ties with its northern neighbor.
However, NATO has labeled China a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia's war effort, and the U.S. and EU have sanctioned hundreds of Chinese nationals and entities over exports deemed to be aiding Russia's military industrial base.
This is notable, as Japan, like the U.S., has imposed export bans aimed at restricting Russia's war effort, including sanctions on military-linked entities and asset freezes.","['quietly', 'china', 'russian', 'military', 'supplies', 'chinese', 'russia', 'machine', 'defense', 'service', 'russias', 'ministry', 'war', 'ukraine', 'minerals']",2025-02-07,https://www.newsweek.com/china-rare-earth-minerals-supply-russia-ukraine-war-2027915,Newsweek,https://www.newsweek.com,negative,-0.1,2025-02-08 09:21:17

“Beijing has obliterated the myth that used to prevail in Washington a few years ago that China can’t innovate – that it can only borrow and steal technology,” said Liza Tobin, managing director at Garnaut Global, a geopolitical-risk advisory firm, during the hearing.
And in her written testimony to the commission, she warned: “We are unprepared to sustain a prolonged conflict with our primary strategic rival.
The US defence industrial base now depends on a potential adversary for critical inputs, from rare earth minerals to advanced electronics and even the energetic materials used in explosives for weapons.”“We risk losing the next industrial revolution, which is unfolding as AI converges with physical industry to transform how things are made,” Tobin added.

9,"Want to get rid of fentanyl? Tackle money-laundering first, say experts - CBC News","The roughly 100 organized crime groups operating in Canada (including three groups dedicated to supplying fentanyl) are partly drawn to loopholes and lax penalties that allow fentanyl-related money-laundering operations to flourish, according to researchers.
""As a result of the overproduction of fentanyl [in Canada], some of this spills over into the United States,"" said Leuprecht.
He added that organized crime groups choose Canada because it puts them inside of what was, at least before the threat of tariffs, a free-trade zone.
Disrupting a crime group's money-laundering operation would be more debilitating than targeting individual fentanyl operations, said Leuprecht.
It also announced in its 2024 budget that it would amend some legislation in the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.","['financial', 'experts', 'crime', 'country', 'say', 'money', 'moneylaundering', 'fentanyl', 'organized', 'canada', 'groups', 'rid', 'tackle', 'laundering']",2025-02-06,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-money-laundering-problem-trump-1.7450357,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca,negative,-0.155,2025-02-07 01:17:11

However, in the months since Synapse’s collapse, Jelena McWilliams, the court-assigned trustee, has identified a $65 to $95 million shortfall between Synapse, bank, and fintech ledgers, impacting hundreds of thousands of fintech customers, including this article’s author.
So, if the fintech or the intermediary messes up, customers’ money held in FDIC-insured accounts is not actually protected.

More recently, post-2008 financial regulations, including stress testing, capital buffers and macroprudential measures, were crafted with past financial crises in mind.
Yet as central banks, financial institutions and regulatory bodies turn to AI models for predictive accuracy, historical analysis risks becoming secondary.
If AI models trained primarily on post-2010 data reinforce similar blind spots, markets could once again be lulled into a false sense of security.

The inclusion and scope of cotenancy provisions are the product of negotiation between landlord and tenant and are creatures of state contract law.
The case before the Court contemplated whether cotenancy provisions are subject to Section 1671, or in effect, whether such provisions are enforceable under California law.

The company’s oversight board has launched an investigation after Meta initially rejected calls to remove a post that used an AI-manipulated video of Ronaldo to promote a gambling app.
But its oversight board, which handles escalated complaints relating to Facebook, Instagram and Threads, says the case merits closer scrutiny of Meta’s policy on scams.
Part of that will see it examine how the social media giant’s decision to end third-party fact-checking last month “could impact the amount of deepfake endorsements”.

15,Teleporting qubits scale quantum computer designs ... - eeNews Europe,"Teleporting qubits scale quantum computer designs Technology News | February 6, 2025 By Nick FlahertyResearchers at Oxford have shown a scalable and deterministic distributed quantum computing network for the first time that can be used for large quantum computer systems.
Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity.
The team at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Oxford used a photonic quantum network to share the states of trapped ion qubits via quantum gate teleportation (QGT).
These uses dedicated network qubits to deterministically teleport the state of a gate between the two circuit qubits in the separate modules with 86% fidelity.

As the use and capabilities of AI technology rapidly expand, Pope Francis argued that humans need to be more responsible about the tech and careful about its impact on various sectors going forward.
The Vatican noted that AI could be used “as an aid to human dignity” by helping people around the world with research and knowledge.
“On a broader scale, by distorting ‘our relationship with others and with reality,’ AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of society,” the document said.
“As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see and hear, polarization and conflict will only grow,” the Vatican said.","['foundations', 'society', 'technology', 'undermine', 'vatican', 'francis', 'ai', 'aigenerated', 'deepfakes', 'document', 'content', 'video', 'pope', 'risks']",2025-02-06,https://www.aol.com/news/vatican-ai-generated-deepfakes-undermine-190224304.html,AOL,https://www.aol.com,positive,0.108,2025-02-07 01:17:11

16,Why Baby Boomers Are Turning to ETFs for Retirement Planning - AOL,"Key PointsJust 5 years ago, Baby Boomers (born from 1946-1964) were a lagging demographic when it came to adoption of ETFs for their investment needs.

If enough Baby Boomers begin to shift assets en masse, the sheer volume could create greater stock market volatility.
This has been attributed to several timing and human nature factors, such as:Many Baby Boomers first started investing during the 1970s and 1980s.
While some Baby Boomers may be familiar with ETFs, they would be facing massive capital gains taxes if they liquidate longtime held mutual fund holdings to swap into ETFs.","['mutual', 'retirement', 'funds', 'etf', 'turning', 'planning', 'baby', 'boomers', 'financial', 'boomer', 'fund', 'etfs']",2025-02-06,https://www.aol.com/why-baby-boomers-turning-etfs-022602453.html,AOL,https://www.aol.com,positive,0.087,2025-02-07 14:42:12

23,Elon Musk team is feeding Department of Education names into AI to find cuts: report - Raw Story,"As part of President Donald Trump's effort to purge the federal government, Elon Musk has begun looking at the Department of Education to cut.
To do it, he fed personally identifiable information into an AI program to have the computer decide where cuts should be made, a report suggests.
According to the Washington Post, the names, information as well as ""sensitive internal financial data"" was included in what was collected by Musk and his team and put into the AI.
""Feeding sensitive data into AI software puts it into the possession of a system’s operator, increasing the chances it will be leaked or swept up in cyberattacks.

16,Vanguard slashed its fees. That's good news — and a lesson in what's a reasonable amount to pay. - Yahoo Finance,"The Vanguard Group this week whacked fees on 168 mutual fund and ETF share classes across 87 funds, lowering its expense ratios by an average of 20%.
It’s the largest annual expense ratio reduction in Vanguard’s nearly 50-year history.
The result: Its average asset-weighted expense ratio is now 0.07% — a fraction of the industry average of 0.44%.
To really understand why you should care about reduced fees — even by fractions of a point — you need to know what a low expense ratio actually means.
The blow to Vanguard’s revenue from the new expense ratio cuts — estimated to be about $350 million this year — is the bigger thing that matters in my opinion.","['etf', 'slashed', 'funds', 'thats', 'fee', 'investors', 'vanguards', 'pay', 'reasonable', 'good', 'lesson', 'fees', 'value', 'ratio', 'expense', 'whats', 'vanguard']",2025-02-06,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-slashed-its-fees-thats-good-news--and-a-lesson-in-whats-a-reasonable-amount-to-pay-100047864.html,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com,positive,0.053,2025-02-07 01:17:11
15,‘Magic-angle’: Graphene’s superconductivity secret can fuel quantum computing - Interesting Engineering,"More recently, researchers found that when two sheets of graphene are stacked on top of each other at a precise ‘magic angle,’ the material assumes a twisted structure but also gains additional properties like superconductivity.
What is superfluid stiffness?
How easily these electron pairs flow depends on multiple conditions and is referred to as superfluid stiffness by the scientific community.
Knowing the superfluid stiffness of MATBG can help scientists better understand why the material behaves like a superconductor.
“Superfluid stiffness refers to how easy it is to get these particles to move to drive superconductivity,” explained Joel Wang, a research scientist at MIT who was involved in the research.","['magicangle', 'properties', 'superfluid', 'structure', 'matbg', 'flow', 'twisted', 'graphene', 'superconductivity', 'material', 'graphenes', 'pairs', 'research', 'stiffness', 'cracks']",2025-02-06,https://interestingengineering.com/science/magic-angle-graphene-superconductivity-quantum-computing,Interesting Engineering,https://interestingengineering.com,positive,0.201,2025-02-07 01:17:11

It is not the first time that scientists have achieved quantum teleportation, with teams previously transferring data from one location to another without moving qubits.
However it is the first demonstration of quantum teleportation of logical gates – the minimum components of an algorithm – across a network link.
“In our study, we use quantum teleportation to create interactions between these distant systems.
By carefully tailoring these interactions, we can perform logical quantum gates – the fundamental operations of quantum computing – between qubits housed in separate quantum computers.","['technology', 'scientists', 'computing', 'researchers', 'transferring', 'quantum', 'supercomputer', 'teleportation', 'oxford', 'achieved', 'qubits', 'achieve', 'university']",2025-02-06,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/oxford-scientists-achieve-teleportation-quantum-183401613.html,Yahoo News UK,https://uk.news.yahoo.com,positive,0.079,2025-02-07 01:17:11

The report outlines how deepfakes, which are artificial audiovisual impersonations of real individuals, are increasingly endangering business reputations and operations.
The evolution of deepfake technology, fuelled by advancements in generative AI, is making it more accessible to those with malicious intent.
Only a fifth of them reported that their organisations were well-informed on the latest developments in deepfake technology, and just 17% had installed social listening or content verification systems.
A particularly alarming statistic from Forrester's report is that 80% of companies do not have dedicated deepfake crisis response plans.","['preparedness', 'deepfake', 'b2b', 'technology', 'significant', 'marketing', 'response', 'leaders', 'businesses', 'threat', 'plans', 'deepfakes', 'looms', 'report']",2025-02-06,https://ecommercenews.co.nz/story/deepfake-threat-looms-for-b2b-marketing-leaders-says-report,New Zealand,https://ecommercenews.co.nz,negative,-0.113,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Hayes contends that a government-backed Bitcoin reserve could introduce volatility into the market.
He notes that political motivations, rather than financial strategy, would dictate the government’s Bitcoin policies, potentially leading to disruptive sell-offs.
Instead of a government-managed Bitcoin reserve, Hayes proposes that Bitcoin should be recognized as a neutral reserve asset that remains independent of state control.
He suggests that a progressive approach to integrating Bitcoin into the global financial system would provide greater long-term stability than direct government intervention.","['financial', 'neutral', 'arthur', 'bill', 'regulatory', 'political', 'net', 'blasts', 'reserve', 'strategy', 'bitcoin', 'hayes', 'negatives', 'strategic', 'suggests', 'policymakers']",2025-02-06,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/02/43532705/arthur-hayes-blasts-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-regulatory-bill-as-net-negatives,Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com,negative,-0.044,2025-02-07 01:17:11

17,Capitol Hill Hearing Pushes for ‘Rational’ Community Banking Regulation - PYMNTS.com,"Beware the dangers of regulatory “overreach” and a one-size-fits-all approach to community banking oversight, several industry participants testified at a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday (Feb. 5).
And according to testimony from some participants, Congress should also look toward repealing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules tied to overdraft fees and small business lending data collection, arguing that open banking rules should also be delayed.
“Community banks have suffered immensely as increased regulatory requirements force them to devote more and more resources to lawyers and check-the-box compliance programs instead of serving their customers,” the Republican contended.
The “rational regulation” of the industry, she said, would also entail placing the CFPB under the congressional appropriations processes.
Among her own recommendations were to raise the deposit insurance cap for small business accounts and require FinTechs to comply with existing consumer compliance laws, which would level the playing field between those digital upstarts and community banks.","['community', 'bank', 'rules', 'cfpb', 'regulation', 'house', 'banking', 'rational', 'regulatory', 'state', 'spotlights', 'congress', 'hearing', 'testimony', 'banks']",2025-02-06,https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2025/capitol-hill-hearing-spotlights-a-push-for-rational-community-banking-regulation/,PYMNTS.com,https://www.pymnts.com,negative,-0.069,2025-02-07 01:17:11

7,The fundamental flaws with early voting - The Korea JoongAng Daily,"While I personally believe such claims are nothing more than unscientific conspiracy theories, I do see legitimate issues with early voting that are entirely separate from these allegations.Introduced in 2014 during local elections, early voting was initially hailed as a way to boost voter turnout.
However, early voting is held four to five days prior to election day, meaning that early voters cast their ballots with access to the latest poll results, while those voting on election day remain in the dark.Take the 2022 presidential election as an example.
The information asymmetry between early voters and election-day voters is not just unfair — it has the potential to alter electoral outcomes.Another fundamental problem with early voting is that it fails to account for late-breaking political developments.
In 2024, Korea spent 68.7 billion won ($51 million) on early voting, surpassing the 68.0 billion won budget for election day voting.
And the fiscal burden of running early voting operations may not be justified when alternative turnout-boosting measures could be more effective.","['election', 'early', 'won', 'flaws', 'day', 'fundamental', 'ballots', 'voting', 'polling', 'cast', 'voters', 'voter']",2025-02-06,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-02-07/opinion/columns/the-fundamental-flaws-with-early-voting/2236739,The Korea JoongAng Daily,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com,positive,0.094,2025-02-07 01:17:11

Three squads of around 50 FBI agents and support personnel for the foreign influence task force are now looking for other assignments, an FBI official with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.
Although they are related, government efforts of tackling foreign influence and prosecuting Foreign Agent Registration Act violations have drawn the ire of President Trump and Republicans for different reasons.
Trump allies bitterly opposed the effort by the FBI’s foreign influence task force to alert social media companies to disinformation on their platforms — a key aspect of the FBI’s work in this area.
In the wake of that ruling, the task force stopped briefing social media companies about foreign influence campaigns on their platforms.","['force', 'task', 'media', 'influence', 'justice', 'fara', 'pam', 'fbi', 'bondi', 'combat', 'trump', 'effort', 'foreign', 'order', 'ends', 'politics']",2025-02-06,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/bondi-ends-fbi-effort-combat-foreign-influence-us-politics-rcna191012,NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com,negative,-0.087,2025-02-07 14:42:12

Some scientists theorize that some of the ways quantum computers process information may resemble how the human brain works.
Quantum computers, however, use qubits, which can exist in a state of quantum superposition, meaning they can be two things at the same time.
This makes quantum computers more powerful than traditional computers because they leverage this quantum ability to coordinate computations more efficiently and steer toward optimal solutions faster.
That said, if quantum activity in the brain is verified, and quantum mechanics is related to human consciousness, it raises some remarkable questions.","['computers', 'maybe', 'think', 'traditional', 'ways', 'humans', 'souls', 'process', 'quantum', 'brain', 'consciousness', 'human']",2025-02-06,https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/where-physics-meets-psychology/202502/if-humans-had-souls-would-they-be-quantum,Psychology Today,https://www.psychologytoday.com,positive,0.15,2025-02-07 01:17:11

The group will also review “unethical prosecutions” stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to the memo.
Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.
Trump praised Bondi’s record as a prosecutor and said she will restore “fair, equal and impartial justice” at the department.

Since the tool made its debut this month, rattling stock markets and more established tech giants like Nvidia, researchers testing its capabilities have found that the answers it gives not only spread Chinese propaganda but also parrot disinformation campaigns that China has used to undercut its critics around the world.
In one instance, the chatbot misstated remarks by former President Jimmy Carter that Chinese officials had selectively edited to make it appear that he had endorsed China’s position that Taiwan was part of the People’s Republic of China.
The example was among several documented by researchers at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, in a Thursday report that called DeepSeek “a disinformation machine.”In the case of the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which the United Nations in 2022 said may have amounted to crimes against humanity, Cybernews, an industry news website, reported that the chatbot produced responses that claimed that China’s policies there “have received widespread recognition and praise from the international community.”","['answers', 'propaganda', 'researchers', 'deepseek', 'include', 'chatbot', 'deepseeks', 'gives', 'china', 'chinese', 'chinas', 'youre', 'disinformation', 'say']",2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/technology/deepseek-chinese-propaganda.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,0.086,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The recently concluded Economic Survey 2024-25 has attributed this higher than expected food inflation to adverse weather conditions and supply chain disruptions.
Food items constitute about two-fifths of the consumer price index in India and hence the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) is a significant determinant of retail inflation.
The domestic food inflation, as per the Economic Survey, was primarily driven by a few food items such as vegetables and pulses.
When these items are excluded, the average food inflation rate for FY25 (April-December) was 4.3 per cent, which is 4.1 per cent lower than the overall food inflation.","['pulses', 'trend', 'cent', 'high', 'vegetables', 'weather', 'inflation', 'food', 'economic', 'overall', 'vagaries', 'remains', 'rate', 'items', 'price', 'survey', 'global']",2025-01-31,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/governance/economic-survey-2024-25-cites-weather-vagaries-as-domestic-food-inflation-remains-high-defying-global-trend,Down To Earth Magazine,https://www.downtoearth.org.in,negative,-0.072,2025-01-31 21:07:24

Wapner noted the irony in Singer’s position, as he has financially supported Trump and related political action committees, despite Elliott’s stark warnings against the crypto market.
Picker confirmed Singer’s political contributions, underscoring a discrepancy between his political support and economic critique.

2,"India must guard against ‘excessive financialisation’, warns Economic Survey - The Indian Express","The Economic Survey 2024-25 has warned that excessive financialisation can harm the economy, with potentially severe consequences for a low-middle-income country like India.
“Financial markets must grow in tandem with the economy’s capital needs and overall economic growth, rather than outpacing them,” it cautioned.
The Survey warned that “over-finance” can lead to the financial sector competing with the real sector for resources, including skilled labour.
Research has shown that rapid financial sector growth often favours projects with high collateral but low productivity, such as construction.
However, the Survey warned that there is a tipping point beyond which financial development can actually hinder economic growth.","['real', 'crisis', 'financialisation', 'growth', 'sector', 'warns', 'warned', 'excessive', 'economic', 'financial', 'economy', 'guard', 'survey', 'india']",2025-01-31,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-guard-against-excessive-financialisation-economic-survey-9809942/,The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com,negative,-0.107,2025-01-31 21:07:24

Cons: The gold market can be volatile, and gold does not generate income like stocks or bonds, leading to potential opportunity costs.

By the end of 2023, China controlled 43.2% of the world’s installed wind energy capacity, making it a dominant player in the market.
With the increasing importance of renewable energy in the global economy, China’s role in controlling key components of the energy supply could give it considerable influence over European energy systems.
This dilemma is especially pronounced given the U.K.’s commitment to meeting carbon reduction goals while transitioning to renewable energy sources.
The growing influence of China in the U.K.’s renewable energy infrastructure raises questions about autonomy, security, and the long-term sustainability of these energy transitions.","['uk', 'faces', 'materials', 'chief', 'mi6', 'sector', 'energy', 'china', 'chinese', 'wind', 'geopolitical', 'reliance', 'growing', 'critical', 'security', 'pressure', 'renewable']",2025-01-31,https://jasondeegan.com/the-u-k-faces-growing-pressure-from-china-in-this-critical-energy-sector-according-to-a-former-mi6-chief/,Jason Deegan,https://jasondeegan.com,positive,0.213,2025-01-31 21:07:24

Toyota’s production dropped by 78% year-on-year in April 2011, as reported by Hirofumi Matsuo in a 2015 paper from Kobe University.
In an era where geopolitical tensions threaten to fragment the global economy, the need for more robust and efficient supply chains has never been more urgent as companies face both fluctuating demand and uncertain disruptions.

The expert witness apparently “could not recall what input or prompt he used to assist him” in cross-checking his calculations with AI (id.).

The economy is seen printing in a 6.4% growth in the current fiscal, which is close to the decadal average.
""Though the macro fundamentals remain robust with a strong external account, calibrated fiscal consolidation and stable private consumption, balancing it with the weak global demand and seasonal domestic factors we expect that the growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8%,"" said the Economic Survey tabled by to Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday.
The survey further says the manufacturing sector faces pressures due to weak global demand and domestic seasonal conditions.
But it quickly also notes that this has been visible across the globe with manufacturing slowing especially in Europe and parts of Asia, due to supply chain disruptions and weak external demand.“ Private consumption remains stable, reflecting steady domestic demand.","['fiscal', 'lowers', 'growth', 'manufacturing', 'forecast', 'stable', 'economic', 'domestic', 'seasonal', 'weak', 'demand', 'survey', 'global', 'poor']",2025-01-31,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2025/Jan/31/economic-survey-lowers-growth-forecast-to-63-68-blaming-weak-global-demand-poor-manufacturing,The New Indian Express,https://www.newindianexpress.com,negative,-0.112,2025-01-31 21:07:24

9,Lawmakers reintroduce anti-fraud freight bill - FreightWaves,"WASHINGTON — The growing threat of freight fraud in trucking has led to another effort by Congress to crack down on scammers that steal millions from legitimate brokers and motor carriers.
Bipartisan legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s nonvoting delegate in the House, would give the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration more power over fake companies attempting to register with the agency.
Specifically, the Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act “would clarify that FMCSA has the authority to assess civil penalties against fraudulent actors that hold consumers’ personal goods hostage, allow FMCSA to leverage states’ enforcement of federal consumer protection laws related to the transportation of household goods and establish requirements to ensure that motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders that seek registration are operating legitimate businesses,” Holmes Norton said in a statement.
“This bill would also provide explicit authority for FMCSA to withhold registration from any applicant that fails to provide a valid principal place of business or disclose common ownership with any other registered entities at the time of registration.”","['norton', 'goods', 'fmcsa', 'antifraud', 'bill', 'legitimate', 'reintroduce', 'provide', 'household', 'lawmakers', 'motor', 'registration', 'protection', 'house', 'freight']",2025-01-30,https://www.freightwaves.com/news/lawmakers-reintroduce-anti-fraud-freight-bill,FreightWaves,https://www.freightwaves.com,negative,-0.1,2025-01-31 21:07:24

23,The Future Of Secure Digital Transactions In The Wake Of Deepfakes - Forbes,"Cyber Security Ransomware Email Phishing Encrypted Technology, Digital Information Protected Secured gettyWith the advent of gen AI and deepfakes, how will we keep digital transactions secure?
With the rapid advancements in generative AI and deepfake capabilities, traditional identity verification methods are becoming increasingly obsolete in securing digital transactions.
It is trivial to construct a fake identity, generate a fake video or falsify income statements, bank records, you name it.
Establishing a secure identity authorization network would give individuals and businesses a secure way to use verified identity to authorize transactions, agreements, content creation, and other digital actions, in a way that we can instantly trust and execute.
By continuously adapting their identity verification strategies, institutions can stay one step ahead and do a much better job of protecting digital transactions, preserving the integrity of our systems of trust in the process.","['secure', 'trust', 'security', 'deepfakes', 'verification', 'better', 'wake', 'digital', 'identity', 'information', 'institutions', 'future', 'transactions']",2025-01-16,https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2025/01/16/the-future-of-secure-digital-transactions-in-the-wake-of-deepfakes/,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,0.2,

But realizing a material that could host such states typically requires a powerful magnetic field, which would hinder device integration.
Now three teams have predicted that non-Abelian states can form in certain semiconductor structures without a magnetic field [1‚Äì3].
Using theoretical modeling and advanced simulations, the groups investigated whether this material could harbor non-Abelian states in zero magnetic field.
Theorists have already devised ways to harness non-Abelian states as workable qubits and manipulate the excitations of these states to enable robust quantum computation.","['levels', 'twist', 'material', 'teams', 'states', 'computing', 'nonabelian', 'quantum', 'magnetic', 'field', 'colleagues', 'semiconductor']",2024-10-16,https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s129,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,0.145,

In North Carolina, we see a powerful example of the impact of the presidential preference gender gap combined with the turnout gender gap.
In states like Michigan, where the presidential gender gap and the turnout gender gap is large, the results can be impressive.
Thus, if both the 2024 gender gap in presidential preference and the 2020 gender gap in turnout remain the same, Harris should win the state by 2.54% or 82,720 votes.
What will not change is that the importance of the gender gap in presidential preference is highly dependent on the existence of a gender gap in turnout.","['2020', 'gap', 'trump', 'gender', 'tip', 'harris', '2024', 'turnout', 'gaps', 'women', 'preference', 'presidential', 'men', 'race']",2024-10-01,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-gender-gaps-could-tip-the-presidential-race-in-2024/,CNN,https://www.cnn.com,positive,0.123,
