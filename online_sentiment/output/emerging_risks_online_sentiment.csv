Even as Harris will certify Trump‚Äôs victory in the 2024 election, the president-elect has telegraphed plans to grant pardons to those convicted for their roles in the Capitol riot.
Most recently, Vice President Al Gore certified his own razor-thin loss to President George W. Bush in 2001, rejecting multiple objections by lawmakers on behalf of his own candidacy.
In 1969, then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey skipped the certification of his loss to Nixon, instead attending the funeral of the UN secretary general.","['vice', 'riot', 'harris', 'presidents', 'thenvice', 'loss', 'victory', 'certify', 'president', 'win', 'moment', 'capitol', 'election', 'trumps', 'american']",2025-01-06,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/politics/kamala-harris-certify-donald-trump-victory/index.html,CNN,https://www.cnn.com,negative,-0.098,

But realizing a material that could host such states typically requires a powerful magnetic field, which would hinder device integration.
Now three teams have predicted that non-Abelian states can form in certain semiconductor structures without a magnetic field [1‚Äì3].
Using theoretical modeling and advanced simulations, the groups investigated whether this material could harbor non-Abelian states in zero magnetic field.
Theorists have already devised ways to harness non-Abelian states as workable qubits and manipulate the excitations of these states to enable robust quantum computation.","['levels', 'twist', 'material', 'teams', 'states', 'computing', 'nonabelian', 'quantum', 'magnetic', 'field', 'colleagues', 'semiconductor']",2024-10-16,https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s129,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,0.145,

In states like Michigan, where the presidential gender gap and the turnout gender gap is large, the results can be impressive.
Thus, if both the 2024 gender gap in presidential preference and the 2020 gender gap in turnout remain the same, Harris should win the state by 2.54% or 82,720 votes.

14,Tech Experts Share Tested And Effective Data Minimization Strategies,"Adopt Data Mesh And Data Fabric ArchitecturesWe can address this with two emerging modern data architecture paradigms: data mesh and data fabric.
Data mesh offers decentralized data management, so that only necessary data is collected, processed and retained by each domain.
