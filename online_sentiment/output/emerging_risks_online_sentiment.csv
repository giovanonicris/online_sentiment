This delay means horses will endure unnecessary pain and abuse for an additional two months, solely to appease industry groups and political pressure.
The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) finalized these long-overdue regulations on May 8th, 2024, marking the most significant improvement to the Horse Protection Act (HPA) since its enactment in 1970.
Yet, despite the clear welfare benefits of this rule, the USDA has once again bowed to industry pressure.
The USDA’s justification—citing pending litigation, industry concerns, and limited departmental resources—is nothing more than an excuse to prioritize political interests over animal welfare.","['animal', 'regulations', 'usda', 'horses', 'horse', 'rule', 'protections', 'usdas', 'stalled', 'delays', 'soring', 'suffer', 'antisoring', 'delay', 'industry', 'continue', 'welfare']",2025-01-31,https://worldanimalnews.com/horses-left-to-suffer-as-usda-delays-enforcement-of-anti-soring-regulation/,World Animal News,https://worldanimalnews.com,negative,-0.186,2025-01-31 21:07:24

Since the tool made its debut this month, rattling stock markets and more established tech giants like Nvidia, researchers testing its capabilities have found that the answers it gives not only spread Chinese propaganda but also parrot disinformation campaigns that China has used to undercut its critics around the world.
In one instance, the chatbot misstated remarks by former President Jimmy Carter that Chinese officials had selectively edited to make it appear that he had endorsed China’s position that Taiwan was part of the People’s Republic of China.
The example was among several documented by researchers at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, in a Thursday report that called DeepSeek “a disinformation machine.”In the case of the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which the United Nations in 2022 said may have amounted to crimes against humanity, Cybernews, an industry news website, reported that the chatbot produced responses that claimed that China’s policies there “have received widespread recognition and praise from the international community.”","['answers', 'propaganda', 'researchers', 'deepseek', 'include', 'chatbot', 'deepseeks', 'gives', 'china', 'chinese', 'chinas', 'youre', 'disinformation', 'say']",2025-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/technology/deepseek-chinese-propaganda.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,positive,+0.086,2025-01-31 21:07:24

15,New Method of Detecting Atom Loss Paves the Way for Quantum Computing Progress - Thomas Insights,"‘Atom loss’ is a pressing matter in quantum computing, and scientists at Sandia National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico (UNM) have developed a method of detecting atom loss without disrupting a qubit’s quantum state.
But before we dive into the discovery, here’s a quick overview on what atom loss is.
A New Technique to Detect Atom LossIt has been nearly impossible to detect atom loss in quantum computers.
It detects atom loss by mapping this information onto a separate ancilla qubit, which acts like an ‘observer’ without disturbing the qubit.
Thanks to their non-destructive method of detecting atom loss, the Sandia-UNM team believes their breakthrough represents a major advancement in quantum computing.","['technique', 'past', 'way', 'rendering', 'sandia', 'computers', 'atom', 'qubits', 'loss', 'problem', 'scientists', 'quantum', 'computing']",2025-01-31,https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/detecting-atom-loss-quantum-computing/,Thomas Insights,https://www.thomasnet.com,negative,-0.103,2025-01-31 21:07:24

6,"The U.K. Faces Growing Pressure from China in This Critical Energy Sector, According to a Former MI6 Chief - Jason Deegan","The United Kingdom is facing increasing concerns over its growing reliance on Chinese components in its wind energy sector, according to Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6.
By the end of 2023, China controlled 43.2% of the world’s installed wind energy capacity, making it a dominant player in the market.
With the increasing importance of renewable energy in the global economy, China’s role in controlling key components of the energy supply could give it considerable influence over European energy systems.
This dilemma is especially pronounced given the U.K.’s commitment to meeting carbon reduction goals while transitioning to renewable energy sources.
The growing influence of China in the U.K.’s renewable energy infrastructure raises questions about autonomy, security, and the long-term sustainability of these energy transitions.","['uk', 'faces', 'materials', 'chief', 'mi6', 'sector', 'energy', 'china', 'chinese', 'wind', 'geopolitical', 'reliance', 'growing', 'critical', 'security', 'pressure', 'renewable']",2025-01-31,https://jasondeegan.com/the-u-k-faces-growing-pressure-from-china-in-this-critical-energy-sector-according-to-a-former-mi6-chief/,Jason Deegan,https://jasondeegan.com,positive,+0.213,2025-01-31 21:07:24

The recently concluded Economic Survey 2024-25 has attributed this higher than expected food inflation to adverse weather conditions and supply chain disruptions.
Food items constitute about two-fifths of the consumer price index in India and hence the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) is a significant determinant of retail inflation.
The domestic food inflation, as per the Economic Survey, was primarily driven by a few food items such as vegetables and pulses.
When these items are excluded, the average food inflation rate for FY25 (April-December) was 4.3 per cent, which is 4.1 per cent lower than the overall food inflation.","['pulses', 'trend', 'cent', 'high', 'vegetables', 'weather', 'inflation', 'food', 'economic', 'overall', 'vagaries', 'remains', 'rate', 'items', 'price', 'survey', 'global']",2025-01-31,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/governance/economic-survey-2024-25-cites-weather-vagaries-as-domestic-food-inflation-remains-high-defying-global-trend,Down To Earth Magazine,https://www.downtoearth.org.in,negative,-0.072,2025-01-31 21:07:24

7,Benson: GOP plan would ‘gut’ Michiganders’ voting rights ahead of next presidential election - The 'Gander,"Michigan’s top elections official is sounding an alarm over Republican-led legislation that would amend the state Constitution and make it harder for eligible citizens to vote.
LANSING—Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is pushing back against a Republican-backed plan to amend the state Constitution to impose stricter voting requirements, calling the proposal an unnecessary rollback of Michiganders’ voting rights.
Citizenship Verification at RegistrationCurrent law:When registering to vote or requesting a ballot, Michiganders must affirm their US citizenship under the penalty of perjury.
Because the plan involves an amendment to the state Constitution, it would need to be approved by Michiganders as a ballot initiative during a general or special election.

Specifically, the Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act “would clarify that FMCSA has the authority to assess civil penalties against fraudulent actors that hold consumers’ personal goods hostage, allow FMCSA to leverage states’ enforcement of federal consumer protection laws related to the transportation of household goods and establish requirements to ensure that motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders that seek registration are operating legitimate businesses,” Holmes Norton said in a statement.

With the rapid advancements in generative AI and deepfake capabilities, traditional identity verification methods are becoming increasingly obsolete in securing digital transactions.
It is trivial to construct a fake identity, generate a fake video or falsify income statements, bank records, you name it.
Establishing a secure identity authorization network would give individuals and businesses a secure way to use verified identity to authorize transactions, agreements, content creation, and other digital actions, in a way that we can instantly trust and execute.
By continuously adapting their identity verification strategies, institutions can stay one step ahead and do a much better job of protecting digital transactions, preserving the integrity of our systems of trust in the process.","['identity', 'information', 'trust', 'secure', 'verification', 'wake', 'future', 'transactions', 'institutions', 'deepfakes', 'digital', 'better', 'security']",2025-01-16,https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2025/01/16/the-future-of-secure-digital-transactions-in-the-wake-of-deepfakes/,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,positive,0.2,1/17/2025 20:39

It was a dismal result for his opponent Dragan Primorac, who had the backing of the governing centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party.
Before becoming president, Milanovic was prime minister of Croatia from 2011 to 2016, and led the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) from 2007 to 2016.
He briefly inserted himself into the country's parliamentary elections last year by announcing he'd be running for prime minister, before a court ruled the move unconstitutional.
The governing HDZ has been the dominant party since Croatia gained independence more than 30 years ago.","['victory', 'croatia', 'minister', 'result', 'response', 'president', 'landslide', 'hdz', 'croatian', 'governing', 'milanovic', 'party', 'reelected', 'prime']",2025-01-13,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwx5910ylyo,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com,positive,0.109,
