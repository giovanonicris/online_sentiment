9,Quantum transducer enables optical control of a superconducting qubit - Physics World,"Superconducting microwave qubits are a promising option for quantum processor nodes, but they currently require bulky microwave components.
The transduction of information between optical and microwave frequencies is therefore key to controlling superconducting microwave qubits without the high thermal cost.
The large energy gap between microwave and optical photons makes it difficult to control microwave qubits with optical signals and requires a microwave–optical quantum transducer (MOQT).
These MOQTs provide a coherent, bidirectional link between microwave and optical frequencies while preserving the quantum states of the qubit.
The team used the CEO-MOQT to facilitate coherent optical driving of a superconducting qubit (controlling the state of the quantum system by manipulating its energy).",enables physics world optical quantum superconducting qubit transducer control microwave qubits frequencies noise system systems photons frequency device future team require cooling components links signals thermal energy moqt electro optic low state resonator modes researchers circuits,2025-04-28,https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-transducer-enables-optical-control-of-a-superconducting-qubit/,Physics World,https://physicsworld.com,Negative,-0.09,2025-04-28 11:01:50,14.0

This strategic move could heighten tensions between the neighboring countries, as the Brahmaputra is a critical water source for millions in northeastern India.
China, which controls the river’s upper stretches where it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo, holds significant leverage over its downstream flow.
While China has previously built dams along the river, it has not officially indicated any immediate plans to halt its flow toward India.

2,How Tariffs Could Hurt America's Independent Grocers - Progressive Grocer,"The National Grocers Association (NGA), the trade association representing the nation’s independent community grocers, sent a letter on April 28 to Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson calling for close monitoring and enforcement action in response to the competitive risks posed by new and proposed tariffs on imported goods.
In its letter, NGA warned that rising tariffs could disrupt the food supply chain, much like the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it said that dominant national retail chains secured priority access to scarce products while smaller, independent and regional grocers were left to deal with empty shelves and frustrated customers.
“Independent grocers once again face the risk of being pushed to the back of the supply line if tariffs trigger product shortages,” said Chris Jones, the chief government relations officer at NGA.
The report concluded that suppliers were forced to prioritize large national chains, leaving independent and regional grocers with product shortages and higher prices.
“When Main Street grocers are sidelined in favor of dominant chains, we risk a repeat of 2020, which neither community grocers nor their customers can afford” Jones added.",hurt america grocers independent tariffs national nga chains letter supply association trade community chain covid pandemic dominant regional customers risk product shortages jones large suppliers disruptions report representing nation federal commission chair andrew ferguson,2025-04-29,https://progressivegrocer.com/how-tariffs-could-hurt-americas-independent-grocers,Progressive Grocer,https://progressivegrocer.com,Negative,-0.765,2025-04-30 12:23:56,5.0

9,Quantum Circuit Supercharges Computing Speed - ScienceBlog.com,"MIT engineers have demonstrated what they believe is the strongest nonlinear light-matter coupling ever achieved in a quantum system, potentially eliminating a major bottleneck in quantum computing and bringing fault-tolerant quantum computers significantly closer to reality.
Unlike conventional computing where stronger connections simply mean faster data transfer, quantum computing involves delicate quantum states that decay rapidly.

7,Opinion | US-China trade war has left ordinary people stuck in the middle - South China Morning Post,"With tariffs ratcheted up over a matter of days earlier this month to stratospheric levels on both sides, what was once a simmering conflict is being pushed to the boil.
One striking aspect of the language surrounding the US-China trade war is that it has been overwhelmingly dominated by narratives of geopolitical rivalry, economic supremacy competition and clashing values.
This erasure reflects a broader pattern in which the “China problem” is framed narrowly through the lens of statecraft and great power competition.
No wonder Chinese students and citizens living in the US are nervous of the atmosphere there.

9,Quantum confinement achieved inside 2D TMD materials - Laser Focus World,"Traditionally, quantum confinement is achieved by shrinking materials down to form nanoparticles and quantum dots, which are known as zero-dimensional materials.
We wanted to explore whether we could achieve similar confinement inside 2D materials.

A study published in ResearchGate found that during economic recessions people redefine their priorities and what constitutes necessities or indulgences.
What CPG and retailers can do Forward-thinking food companies and retailers can leverage these consumption patterns in several ways.
A study published in Appetite examined relationships between food consumption patterns and economic growth found that for low income countries, GDP increase is accompanied by changes towards food consumption patterns with large gaps between supply and actual consumption - insights that can help manufacturers target appropriate markets during economic transitions.
In these turbulent and uncertain economic times, food companies and retailers that monitor and respond to these subtle shifts in food consumption gain valuable lead time to adjust strategies before competitors who wait for official economic declarations.",consumer signal downturn economic food consumption patterns consumers recession premium research recessions shifts increase share alternatives retailers past buy study increased sales canned times budget brands market categories income foods billion change subtle ways data,2025-04-30,https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillempert/2025/04/30/consumer-food-consumption-patterns-signal-economic-downturn/,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com,Positive,0.8271,2025-05-01 12:04:00,1.0

9,New Study Suggests Gravity May Be an Optimization Process in a Computational Universe - The Quantum Insider,"Physicist Melvin M. Vopson derives Newton’s law of gravity from information theory, proposing that matter moves to minimize information entropy, mirroring optimization routines seen in quantum computation.
Rather than treating gravity as a built-in feature of the universe, Vopson reframes it as a byproduct of information entropy minimization — a kind of cosmic data compression routine.
While not directly addressed in the study, for researchers in quantum information science, this idea resonates with a broader shift toward seeing nature as inherently computational.
That could happen, perhaps not by recreating spacetime geometry, but by mimicking how information entropy evolves.
This raises another speculative question: could a sufficiently large quantum computer replicate gravity by running the right algorithm?",suggests process gravity universe study computational optimization information quantum entropy vopson law computer force theory entropic model space newton matter computation informational nature mass universe vopson spacetime behavior physics system fundamental offers work systems drive,2025-04-30,https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/04/30/new-study-suggests-gravity-may-be-an-optimization-process-in-a-computational-universe/,The Quantum Insider,https://thequantuminsider.com,Positive,0.3506,2025-04-30 12:23:56,14.0

This study shifts the focus from exact optimization (where quantum advantage remains unproven) to approximate optimization, an area with broad applicability in industry and science.
Quantum annealing is a specific type of quantum computing that can use quantum physics principles to find high-quality solutions to difficult optimization problems.
To demonstrate algorithmic quantum scaling advantage, the researchers used a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealing processor, a specialized type of quantum computing device installed at USC’s Information Sciences Institute.

9,"FSU scientists discover exotic states of matter in graphene, offering new possibilities for quantum computing - Florida State University News","The states of matter discovered by Lu and colleagues exhibit what are called quantum anomalous Hall states, meaning electric current can flow along the edges of the material with zero resistance and without needing a magnetic field.
More specifically, researchers found both an electron crystal state showing integer quantum anomalous Hall states, in which electrical conductance values are restricted to whole numbers, as well as fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, meaning they measured electrical conductance that reached fractional values instead of only integers.
“If the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is combined with a superconductor, the resulting quantum computer will be more efficient than current quantum computers and free of error.
“Think of the fractional states as liquid, like flowing water, while the electron crystal state — what we call the extended quantum anomalous Hall state — resembles electron ice,” Lu said.

9,IQM Unveils Star Architecture: A Resonator-Centric Quantum Processor with Effective All-to-All Connectivity - Quantum Computing Report,"IQM Quantum Computers has introduced a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) architecture known as IQM Star, which departs from traditional grid-based designs by using a central superconducting resonator to connect multiple qubits.
This effective all-to-all connectivity enables direct, high-fidelity interactions between any pair of qubits, significantly reducing the need for noisy SWAP gates.
The architecture supports more flexible quantum error correction (QEC) schemes and improves circuit execution efficiency for connectivity-intensive algorithms.
IQM envisions that the Star topology could support hardware-efficient QEC codes, accelerate developments in quantum machine learning, and expand the computational role of resonators in future quantum systems.

This global control approach uses this blockade effect for selective control so that operations are performed only where and when needed.
Planckian’s global control approach significantly reduces wiring density to minimize crosstalk, noise, and operational costs while simplifying packaging and cryogenic integration.

4,South Korea’s top court to rule on presidential frontrunner’s case as election looms - 朝日新聞,"SEOUL--South Korea’s Supreme Court will issue a ruling on Thursday in a case involving presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung, which could disqualify the former opposition party leader from contesting the country’s June 3 election.
Lee, the candidate of the liberal Democratic Party which controls parliament, leads opinion polls to win a snap presidential election sparked by former conservative president Yoon Suk Yeol’s ouster over his imposition of martial law.
In March, an appeals court had cleared Lee of violating the election law, but prosecutors had appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
Lee is embroiled in several criminal trials, but the election law case is in the spotlight because if the Supreme Court overturns Lee’s not guilty verdict and it is finalized, it would bar him from contesting elections for at least five years.

The renewed trade war has intensified pressure on Cook to replicate the diplomatic maneuvering that previously helped shield the iPhone from tariffs during Trump’s first term.",amid war apple iphones india ceo sourced china trade cook tariffs earnings billion tim tariff months country origin rising tensions imports cost million pressures reported profit increase revenue quarter majority sold sales impact,2025-05-01,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/most-us-iphones-to-be-sourced-in-india-says-apple-ceo-amid-trade-war-with-china/articleshow/120803866.cms,Times Of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com,Negative,-0.887,2025-05-02 11:56:20,10.0

There is some good economic news: In April the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, while employers added 177,000 jobs.
However, even if demand goes down and tariff-driven inflation cools, inflation will remain as long as those tariffs are in place, said Gary Hoover, an economics professor at Tulane University.
The link between inflation and unemployment has weakened over the past couple of decades, said Brian Jenkins, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine.

9,IonQ Demonstrates Quantum-Enhanced Applications Advancing AI - The Quantum Insider,"Insider Brief IonQ has demonstrated two new hybrid quantum-classical methods that enhance large language models and generate synthetic materials data, signaling progress in practical AI applications using quantum computing.
In a second project, IonQ used quantum-enhanced GANs to create synthetic steel microstructure images, outperforming classical models in image quality and supporting data-scarce industrial AI workflows.
This paves the way for quantum-enhanced fine-tuning of broader classes of foundational AI models, including AI models for natural language processing, image processing, and property prediction in chemistry, biology and materials science.
“This work highlights how quantum computing can be strategically integrated into classical AI workflows, taking advantage of increased expressivity to enhance traditional AI LLMs in rare-data regimes,” said Masako Yamada, Director of Applications Development IonQ.

Overall, McDonald’s revenues fell 3% year-on-year to $5.96 billion, with net income down 3% to $1.87 billion.

Factoring In Spousal Benefits Camerino recommends fully exploring spousal benefits as a way of increasing cash flow in retirement.

So, the warm and chaotic environment of, say, a human brain, is far from ideal for quantum processes.
However, for decades, some theories (that have slowly become less out there with age) have suggested that quantum processes could in fact be occurring in the brain.
Combined with QBL’s discovery last year, an idea has taken shape that aneural organisms may be able to use these quantum signals to process information.

9,MIT engineers achieve breakthrough in fault-tolerant quantum computing - Open Access Government,"MIT engineers have achieved a major leap towards fault-tolerant quantum computing by demonstrating an order-of-magnitude stronger nonlinear light-matter coupling.
Overcoming bottlenecks in quantum processing Quantum computers hold the promise of revolutionising fields ranging from materials science to machine learning.
The readout process, where quantum information is measured, is particularly critical and relies on the strength of the interaction between photons (light particles carrying quantum information) and artificial atoms (qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computers).
This breakthrough, utilising a novel superconducting circuit architecture, could potentially accelerate quantum processors by a similar factor, bringing the era of practical quantum computing closer to reality.

Specifically, the DPC stated that TikTok did not provide sufficient evidence that data accessible from China was safeguarded in compliance with EU regulations.
The company maintains that it has implemented new security measures since 2023, including an independent monitoring system for remote data access and the storage of EU user data in data centers located in Europe and the United States.
In February 2024, the company discovered that a small amount of EU user data had been inadvertently stored in China, which has since been deleted.",fines usd violations data tiktok eu million protection user privacy ruling companies dpc regulations tech practices tiktok users compliance fine decision scrutiny personal eu laws including company dpc europe approach global commission hefty euros,2025-05-03,https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/eu-fines-tiktok-600-million-usd-for-data-violations-342580,Evrim Ağacı,https://evrimagaci.org,Positive,0.6705,2025-05-04 10:08:21,9.0

In 2020, Dr Mahathir warned that US President Donald Trump’s return would bring “disaster” and nothing in the intervening years has changed his mind, Time said.
“When I talked to him, it was about development, increasing trade, basically to be less communistic, to make use of capitalist ideology,” Dr Mahathir said.",stop growing ex malaysian mahathir china dr power told mr russia nato prime minister interview world putin united states provoking conflict magazine american south sea america asia zealand age busy president things rights countries trump,2025-05-03,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/you-cant-stop-china-from-growing-says-ex-malaysian-pm-mahathir,The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com,Negative,-0.7717,2025-05-03 11:49:39,10.0

Earlier this week, IBM announced that it would be investing $30 billion over the next five years to develop quantum computers.
Some labs are hitting back with their own experiments, proving that classical computers can still hold their own against quantum computers.

Approximate optimization Scientists have been struggling to demonstrate quantum scaling advantage (where the quantum advantage grows as the problem size increases) by the use of a quantum annealer for years.
Quantum annealing is a specific type of quantum computing that can use quantum physics principles to find high-quality solutions to difficult optimization problems.
To demonstrate algorithmic quantum scaling advantage, the researchers used a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealing processor, a specialized type of quantum computing device installed at USC's Information Sciences Institute.

Despite a tariff pause, Goldman Sachs estimates a significant chance of a recession within the next year, highlighting growing economic uncertainty.
Dalio, who accurately predicted the 2008 financial crisis, pointed to President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies as a major destabilizing force.
Despite the pause, Goldman Sachs economists peg the odds of a U.S. recession within the next year at 45%, a downgrade from their earlier prediction of a recession as the most likely outcome.
