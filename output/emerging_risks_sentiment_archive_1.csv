This method generates random numbers from a quantum computer that are then verified using classical supercomputers, allowing the now-certified random numbers to be safely used as passkeys for encrypted communications.
“Quantum computers and quantum technologies offer the only way to reliably generate and test randomness,” Yuen says.
First, the quantum computer is given a complex problem that requires it to generate random outputs, in a process called random circuit sampling.
The quantum computer must generate its outputs faster than they could be mimicked (or “spoofed”) by any known classical computing method.",makes random number breakthrough quantum computer classical random randomness aaronson it numbers computers protocol computing generate qubits advantage university supercomputers outputs national generated certified task system important outcome process fefferman work test bits team quantinuum laboratory,2025-04-21,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-computer-makes-random-number-breakthrough/,Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com,Positive,0.6908,2025-04-21 18:25:54,14.0

The researchers found that, rather than conspiracy beliefs leading to criticism of democratic institutions or support for authoritarianism, it may be that people who already favor authoritarian forms of government are more likely to adopt conspiracy beliefs—especially during elections.
Over the past decade, conspiracy theories have become a prominent concern in political discourse.
Instead, the results suggested the opposite pattern: individuals who showed increased support for authoritarian government were more likely to adopt conspiracy beliefs later on.

However, that retirement goal is still high, Roberts added, “far beyond what many people have actually saved.” ‘Magic number’ vs. average retirement balances Last year, positive market conditions helped propel retirement account balances near new highs.
“The shift toward relying on retirement savings heightens the importance of grounding yourself in a financial plan as early as you can,” Assaf said.

Jewellery demand could face further pressure across key regions in 2025 if gold prices remain elevated or volatile, the WGC said in its gold demand trends report published in February.

On Tuesday, April 22, the court ruled that Thiam had lost his Ivorian nationality, a decision that is final and cannot be appealed.
According to his lawyer, Me Ange Rodrigue Dadjé, the court determined that Thiam lost his Ivorian nationality when he acquired French citizenship, and therefore granted the request to remove him from the electoral list.
Born in Ivory Coast, Thiam acquired French citizenship in 1987 but renounced it in March to meet the eligibility requirements for the presidency, as candidates cannot hold dual nationality.

Beyond LNG, Europe imports gas from Norway, North Africa and Turkey via pipeline.
Several major economies, including the United States, Britain, EU members, China and Australia, today hold strategic oil reserves, typically equivalent to 90 days of their fuel consumption.
European governments could use some of the many depleted oil and gas fields dotted across the North Sea to store strategic gas reserves.

With these limits on big private spending, public financing accounts for a substantial portion of money in Canadian elections.
Canada’s campaign finance rules interlock to create a political system where one of the defining features of U.S. politics — massive private spending — is absent.
Meanwhile, public polling consistently indicates that a majority of Americans support a vision of campaign finance regulation, including contribution and spending limits, that resembles Canada’s system more than our present reality.",finance system americans spending limits canadian campaigns donors public united expenditures candidates political election states wealthy financing canada dollars money canadians federal unlimited american politics presidential elections court role majority vote contributions vision reformers,2025-04-23,https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/campaign-finance-system-americans-could-have-had,Brennan Center For Justice,https://www.brennancenter.org,Positive,0.9612,2025-04-24 12:04:41,9.0

Over the past 20 years, China’s military has “dramatically advanced its development of conventional and nuclear-armed hypersonic missile technologies,” including the YJ-21 hypersonic missile, which is designed to target aircraft carriers, the Defense Department’s report says.
A primary fear that U.S. warplanners have of hypersonic weapons is the threat they pose to U.S. Navy ships.
So, it stays a lot lower, closer to the Earth’s surface, than a ballistic missile does, which means it pops over the horizon a lot later than a ballistic missile would.

Kollar-Kotely rejected the plaintiffs’ request to block three other parts of Trump’s order because the claims were premature or were better addressed by a different court.
Trump’s order is an apparent attempt to bolster the false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.

ADVERTISEMENT The university leader said that he believed Hong Kong should be used as a hub for the “free flow” of research collaborations, technology transfer and student exchanges.
In recent weeks, some international students in the US have had their visas revoked, while Trump’s tariffs policy has exacerbated hostility between the countries – with both adding to growing nervousness among Chinese students about studying abroad.
“This next 10 years is a golden opportunity for Hong Kong and Macao to develop themselves into study-abroad centres,” Teng said.

4,Three possible ruling scenarios await Lee Jae-myung - The Korea Herald,"With South Korea’s Supreme Court expediting its review of alleged election law violations involving former Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, speculation is mounting over whether the court will issue a verdict before the upcoming presidential election on June 3.
Lee, the liberal presidential frontrunner, was acquitted by the Seoul High Court in March, overturning a previous ruling by the Seoul Central District Court that had sentenced him to one year in prison.
The Supreme Court now has three options: uphold the acquittal, overturn it, or suspend proceedings — the latter of which legal experts say could become relevant if Lee wins the presidency and claims immunity.
The Supreme Court reviewed Lee’s case on Tuesday — the same day it was assigned to the justices — and held a second hearing on Thursday, just two days later.
If the Supreme Court reverses the acquittal before the election, Lee could lose both his parliamentary seat and his eligibility to run for public office for a decade.",scenarios await jae myung lee ruling court supreme election case public cases verdict presidential seoul high legal lee justices review democratic acquittal decision late act months assigned presiding office kim development seongnam chief justice south korea,2025-04-24,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10473087,The Korea Herald,https://www.koreaherald.com,Positive,0.9201,2025-04-24 12:04:41,7.0

9,Cooling down the quantum realm - Laser Focus World,"The significance of autonomous quantum machines The fact that this useful quantum refrigerator operates autonomously is a significant novelty.
The quantum absorption refrigerator operates on a similar principle, using a “hot” quantum system to extract heat from another “cold” quantum system, albeit through fundamentally quantum mechanical interactions rather than classical thermodynamics of fluids.

Until now, scientists have studied cosmic radiation by setting up quantum chips inside shielded cryogenic refrigeration systems, or “fridges,” deep underground with detectors underneath them, waiting for cosmic rays to strike.
APL is home to a linear accelerator that can be used to drive electrons to energy levels that simulate cosmic ray muons.
That means that instead of simply waiting for cosmic rays to strike, APL scientists can actively reproduce them.

Currency dealers and analysts attributed the rupee’s modest depreciation to intensifying global and regional geopolitical tension, which has led to heightened demand for safe-haven currencies like the US dollar.
Locally, the rupee is grappling with increased dollar demand fueled by end-of-month corporate settlements and import-related payments.
These seasonal factors have triggered temporary shortages of foreign currency in the interbank market, amplifying the rupee’s vulnerability to external shocks.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce parts of the order requiring federal election officials to assess whether people who are registering to vote are citizens.
She declined, however, to block parts of the order that sought to force states not to count mail-in ballots received after election day.

5,"Amid Ethiopian Sea Claims, Egypt and Djibouti Reaffirm Red Sea Control - Borkena","Their agreement to contribute troops to the new African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) further demonstrates a shared commitment to containing insecurity that could potentially impact Red Sea maritime security.
Conversely, some analysts propose that Ethiopia’s renewed pursuit of sea access may serve purposes beyond purely strategic or economic ones.
The security of the Red Sea, a vital global maritime corridor, is increasingly intertwined with the internal dynamics of these fragile states.
Consequently, Egypt’s efforts to spearhead regional discussions on Red Sea governance may also be an attempt to preempt external interference, whether from neighboring landlocked states or global powers.
As the situation continues to unfold, Ethiopia’s pursuit of sea access could test not only its bilateral relationships with Eritrea and Djibouti but also the evolving security consensus among Red Sea nations.",sea amid ethiopian claims reaffirm control red egypt djibouti access maritime states ethiopia ethiopia regional security landlocked strategic borkena internal addis ababa discussions today horn egypt economic clear conflict business president tensions geopolitical africa actions,2025-04-24,https://borkena.com/2025/04/24/ethiopia-news-analysis-amid-ethiopian-sea-claims-egypt-and-djibouti-reaffirm-red-sea-control/,Borkena,https://borkena.com,Positive,0.8807,2025-04-25 12:06:20,8.0

The tension has extended into the country’s art scene, as Suzana Vasilescu, the founder of Bucharest’s Suprainfinit gallery, explains.
While commentators suggest that the socially conservative messaging stirred up by the election has yet to directly impact the freedom of such events, members of the art scene remain vigilant.
“While the rise of socially conservative rhetoric does raise concerns, particularly around cultural values and inclusivity, the art scene has responded with critical engagement rather than retreat,” Vartic says.
As a result, she says, many in the art scene rely on a mixture of private and corporate support, international grants and “simply making do”.",romania remains vigilant art scene election presidential re run ahead romania country vasilescu political party support simion romanian values gallery rad socially culture works romanians vote russia far right candidate victory leading capital bucharest cancellation social tension,2025-04-24,https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2025/04/24/romania-presidential-election-art-scene-remains-vigilant,The Art Newspaper,https://www.theartnewspaper.com,Positive,0.9211,2025-04-24 12:04:41,7.0

4,Judge pauses parts of Trump's sweeping executive order on voting - NPR,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has paused a key section of President Trump's executive order that makes sweeping changes to voting and elections.
Critics of Trump's March 25 executive order say it could disenfranchise millions of would-be voters, and exceeds presidential authority.
Trump's executive order essentially seeks to implement much of the SAVE Act by executive decree — a move the judge rejected.
Kollar-Kotelly's order is, for now, a legal victory for voter registration groups and Democrats that are challenging Trump's far-reaching executive order in three lawsuits that have been consolidated.
Kollar-Kotelly said this provision is in conflict with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which mandates those agencies give out voter registration forms, unless an applicant opts out.",pauses parts sweeping order executive trump voting judge election voter vote registration citizenship federal president elections kollar kotelly washington court states act register provision plaintiffs state noncitizens millions voters authority eac national mail save,2025-04-24,https://www.npr.org/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5372526/trump-voting-executive-order-pause,Npr,https://www.npr.org,Negative,-0.2656,2025-04-25 12:06:20,7.0

4,Trump’s Executive Order on Proof of Citizenship for Elections Is Partly Blocked by Judge - The New York Times,"A federal judge blocked part of an expansive executive order signed last month seeking to overhaul election laws, writing on Thursday that President Trump did not have the authority to require documentary proof of citizenship for all voters.
“Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states — not the president — with the authority to regulate federal elections,” wrote Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington.
The legal concerns with this provision, Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote, are being considered in other cases brought by state attorneys general.
The executive order, signed in early March, sought to direct the federal Election Assistance Commission to amend its voter registration form and require any potential voter to show documentary proof of citizenship to register.

2,Indian aviation industry takes off as FY24-25 closes with 7.8% growth - Mathrubhumi English,"India's aviation sector has soared to new heights, concluding the fiscal year 2024–25 with a robust 7.8% year-on-year increase in domestic air passenger traffic, reaching approximately 165.7 million travelers.
This significant growth underscores the industry's resilience and recovery amidst various operational challenges.​ To advertise here, According to the latest data released by ICRA (formerly Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited), domestic air traffic for March 2025 was estimated at around 14.88 million passengers.
These challenges led to significant fleet groundings and operational delays, yet the sector managed to maintain an upward trajectory.​ ICRA notes that while the pace of earnings recovery is expected to be gradual due to the high fixed-cost nature of the aviation business, the outlook remains stable.
The agency estimates a net loss of INR2,000–3,000 crore for the industry in FY25 and FY26, a shift from the approximate INR1,600 crore net profit reported in FY24.
Nevertheless, ICRA anticipates a year-on-year revenue growth between 18% and 20% for the current fiscal year, driven by sustained improvements in passenger traffic, tariff adjustments, and the expansion of non-aeronautical revenue streams.​",indian takes closes aviation growth industry passenger traffic million icra airlines sector fiscal year year increase domestic air significant recovery operational challenges latest agency passengers maintain net crore sustained revenue,2025-04-24,https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/india/india-aviation-growth-financial-year-2024-2025-1.10535136,Mathrubhumi English,https://english.mathrubhumi.com,Positive,0.9559,2025-04-25 12:06:20,5.0

But the judge allowed other parts of Trump’s sweeping executive order on U.S. elections to go forward for now, including a directive to tighten mail ballot deadlines around the country.
They also argued that Trump’s order asserts power that he does not have over an independent agency.
That agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, sets voluntary voting system guidelines and maintains the federal voter registration form.
During an April 17 hearing, attorneys for the plaintiffs had said requiring proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form would complicate their clients’ voter registration drives at grocery stores and other public places.",halts parts overhaul elections trump judge requirement including proof citizenship order federal democratic voter registration citizenship plaintiffs election run form decision public executive argued voters states vote trump president country league national rights congress proof,2025-04-24,https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/24/trump-elections-overhaul/,Boston Herald,https://www.bostonherald.com,Negative,-0.5023,2025-04-25 12:06:20,7.0

1,Is The U.S. Entering A Stagflation Trap? Warning Signs Grow As Tariffs Weigh On Economy - gondwanauniversity.org,"The U.S. economy is showing mounting signs of entering a dangerous period of stagflation—a toxic mix of stagnant growth, rising inflation, and high unemployment—driven largely by renewed tariff policies under former President Donald Trump.
Recent economic data and expert forecasts point to a sharply deteriorating outlook, raising recession risks while inflation expectations continue to climb.

2,How Vector Consulting Group Enables Agility In Auto Manufacturing - Mobility Outlook,"Manufacturing schedules in automotive plants are highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in market dynamics and supply chain disruptions. Sudden shifts in market demand or interruptions in component availability can quickly destabilise production plans for both vehicle manufacturers and their Tier-1 suppliers.

Despite rigorous efforts by procurement teams, it is common for assembly schedules to remain unsettled for entire days or even shifts, primarily due to shortages of complete assembly kits. This leads to rising work-in-progress inventories mid-month, resulting in substantial but uneven spikes of dispatches towards month-end. This recurring pattern not only causes substantial capacity wastage but also restricts automotive companies from harnessing the full potential of their manufacturing capabilities.

Yet, even amid industry-wide challenges impacting two-, three-, four-wheelers, and commercial vehicle segments, certain manufacturers have managed to significantly outperform peers. According to Ravindra Patki, Senior Partner at Vector Consulting Group (VCG), such exceptional performance is attainable through targeted collaboration and strategic operational interventions between the vehicle maker and expert consultants.

Over the years, VCG has partnered with leading names like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Sonalika Tractors, TVS Motors, Royal Enfield, Fleetguard Filters, and JK Fenner to set new benchmarks in operational performance across diverse business areas.

Elaborating on the company’s innovative approach to tackling these complex manufacturing challenges, Patki explained to Mobility Outlook that achieving transformative outcomes requires the entire supply chain to perform at significantly higher levels than currently observed. Illustrating this, he cited the example of a two-wheeler manufacturer that previously fulfilled only 35% of dealer orders on the same day. Through implementing VCG’s targeted solution, same-day order fulfilment surged dramatically to 75%, with fulfilment rising to 95% within just three days. This remarkable improvement was achieved by strategically stocking materials at the nearest depots, enabling rapid and efficient supply. Consequently, a manufacturer that once struggled with delivery timelines can now confidently fulfil nearly all orders within three days, guaranteeing complete deliveries within seven days.

Guided Transformation

However, Patki emphasised that such results are not achieved simply by handing clients a set of recommendations. Effective transformation demands continuous expert support throughout the implementation phase. Traditional consulting methods, he noted, typically offer advice without active involvement during execution, leaving clients prone to reverting to old practices when facing hurdles. VCG, in contrast, remains closely engaged with clients, guiding them meticulously through every stage of the change process, he explained.

“Our engagements are deeply implementation-oriented. We actively collaborate with clients to transition smoothly from existing practices to more effective, efficient strategies,” he added. Achieving objectives such as improved vehicle availability often necessitates adjustments not only at the dealership level but also upstream, in procurement and supplier coordination. Patki underscored that VCG’s approach is holistic—never confined to isolated functional improvements but aimed at aligning the entire supply chain, from raw material suppliers through to end-customers, towards a unified, mutually-agreed goal.

Navigating Supply Chain Volatility

Addressing the critical challenge of supplier inventory management, Patki highlighted that suppliers often bear the brunt when supply chains depend heavily on forecast-based planning. Suppliers frequently ramp up production based on overly optimistic monthly projections, only to experience sudden drops in orders. Without real-time visibility into demand fluctuations, they find themselves burdened with excessive inventory, tying up crucial working capital—a particularly acute issue for MSME and SME suppliers.

VCG addresses this imbalance by transitioning OEMs from traditional monthly forecasting towards a real-time, demand-driven inventory model. “We provide suppliers with immediate visibility into actual stock levels at the OEM end, allowing them to produce precisely what is required. This strategy prevents unnecessary inventory buildup, aligning supplier output closely with real demand and significantly improving cash flow efficiency,” he explained.

Instant Insights, Smarter Decisions

Patki further noted that VCG’s model promotes daily, real-time communication between OEMs and suppliers. Suppliers gain clarity not only on current stock positions but also on the urgency of specific components based on their risk of imminent stockouts. With this actionable data, suppliers can effectively manage raw materials and production schedules, ensuring timely availability at the OEMs without unnecessary inventory accumulation. This shift empowers suppliers to operate flexibly and responsively, significantly reducing waste and disruptions in the overall supply chain.

Tackling Complexity With Flexibility

The automotive industry is increasingly transitioning from mass production to mass customisation—a shift dramatically reshaping traditional manufacturing paradigms. Many new-age vehicle makers offer multiple variants of the same model, complicating traditional daily production planning methods. Highlighting this critical transformation, Patki acknowledged the immense challenge this poses, noting that the conventional practice of converting weekly production schedules into daily plans inevitably leads to disruptions when suppliers fail to deliver components on time, triggering chaos across the entire supply chain.

To address this challenge, VCG proposes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than relying on rigid production schedules, the firm advocates for maintaining consistent availability of all essential components, enabling production teams to respond flexibly to real-time demand fluctuations. This proactive method involves daily communication of stock positions with suppliers, ensuring their production precisely mirrors actual consumption patterns, substantially reducing work-in-progress inventory and streamlining supply chain operations.

Patki emphasised that this strategy has successfully been deployed with several commercial vehicle manufacturers, two-wheeler OEMs, and automotive component suppliers, leading to notable reductions in supplier-side inventory issues. By shifting towards a demand-driven supply model, suppliers are safeguarded against abrupt production plan changes that traditionally left them with incomplete components and excess stock.

Change Begins Where The Chain Begins

Addressing concerns that OEMs often leverage their dominance to transfer inventory risks downstream to dealers and suppliers, Patki agreed that genuine transformation must begin at the OEM level. The firm, therefore, engages closely with OEMs to implement fundamental improvements in their supply chain management practices. Additionally, it has empowered various component suppliers—ranging from manufacturers of window regulators and belts to small vehicle parts—to independently shield themselves from OEM-induced demand volatility through vendor-managed inventory (VMI) solutions, creating a resilient and balanced supply ecosystem, he concluded.

Dr. Tudorel Toader, a former judge and justice minister, criticised the Ploiești judge who he said had managed to put his name into public discussion, even if through an inadmissible decision, outside the constitutional legal requirements.
The official reportedly now faces a disciplinary investigation.
Others have stressed that the overturning will not impact upcoming presidential elections, two-round ballots for which are due to be held on May 4th and 18th, though confusion reigns.
